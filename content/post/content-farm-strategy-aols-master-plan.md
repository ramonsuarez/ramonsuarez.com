via [businessinsider.com](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-aol-way?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+businessinsider+(Business+Insider))</div>A very interesting read about AOL’s strategy and management. It is scary to see how little people get paid, but it goes in line with what happens in journalism. Only a few make a living.

[Paying peanuts per post](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/i_worked_on_the_aol_content_farm_it_changed_my_lif.php?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+readwriteweb+(ReadWriteWeb)) is way too common right now, if the posts are not just free. The worst of it is the lack of sustainability of this model that leads to an ever decreasing number of journalists and bloggers, standardization of news, lack of research, reduction of sources and amateurization of the whole writing business.
