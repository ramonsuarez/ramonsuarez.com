![](/uploads/2013/02/media_https1i1picplzt_uegbd-scaled500.jpg)via [picplz.com](http://picplz.com/user/ramonsuarez/pic/63qbb/)I just had the chance of finding myself in a pannel about digital communication with **[Steve Rubel](http://twitter.com/steverubel)** and [**Patrick Bosteels**](http://twitter.com/patrickbosteels). The event was named “**A sneak peek into the future of digital communications**“, but we got much more. Gotta run to a meeting, so I leave you here my **notes and the audio** of the full conference and Q&A.
