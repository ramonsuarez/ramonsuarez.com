<div class="posterous_quote_citation">via [founderinstitute.com](http://www.founderinstitute.com/posts/328)</div>Adeo wrotte a great article on TechCrunch about why it is [nonsense to say that entrepreneurs peak at 25](http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/28/peak-age-entrepreneurship).

He included this four charts with stats about the Founder Institute’s participants that are quite interesting.

- Allmost all participants are over 25 years old
- **77% of the graduated companies are progressing ahead of their plan**

This last point stresses what I like the most about the [Founder Institute](http://www.founderinstitute.com/): **it is about doing**. There’s no better place to help you transform your idea into a company in just 4 months.
