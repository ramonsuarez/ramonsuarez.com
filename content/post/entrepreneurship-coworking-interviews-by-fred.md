[Fred Ooms](http://www.linkedin.com/in/fredooms "Fred Ooms blog") has just finished publishing the interview we had a couple months ago. It was really nice to have some time to talk entrepreneurship with somebody like Fred, alumnus of MBA Solvay like myself, and also working with a university to try to bring part of their research knowledge and patents to market. We just set up a video call and got the interview rolling. Nice, lean and true. In his blog you can find a great selection of [entrepreneurship video interviews](http://blog.thebraintwist.com/ "Entrepreneurship video interviews Fred Ooms").
