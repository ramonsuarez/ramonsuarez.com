I’m [not good with video yet](http://ramonsuarez.com/fail-2-deadlines-and-video/), but there are many other delivery methods to share valuable content and help many people. So I’m going to continue working on the [Coworking Community Course](https://www.coworkinghandbook.com/coworking-community-course-draft/) with a text only course.

The core of the course is ready, I have about 130 slides with a mix of information and exercises. It is a workbook focused on getting coworking space operators to take actions that will help them build a vibrant and healthy communities while they are taking the course and that will give provide a toolbox they can keep on using and referring to. It will be delivered in daily bits, like a challenge, not to overload the participants and to nudge them into taking repeated action.

---------------------

- Write down **timeline, deliverables and milestones**.
- **Find the tool or platform to deliver it**. Ideally WordPress or an external service that I can set as a sub domain of [The Coworking Handbook.](https://www.coworkinghandbook.com)
- **Adapt copy to written email delivery**. The slides where thought of as my script for the video courses. I need to extend the bullet points.
- **ecide on a final name**. I like the idea of a challenge.
- **Make a landing page with at least one image that I create** to support the course.
- **Create a lead magnet and a short email sequence to convert to students**.
- **Find a way to or create forms to submit workbook to dos**.
- **Find a way to automatically generate a final document with all the workbooks submissions from the students**. This is a nice have, so I will probably do it manually first.
- **Get to work!** I’ve been too slow lately. No failure sobbing!
