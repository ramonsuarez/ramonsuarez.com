Hereâ€™s the list of **my favorite places to eat and drink in Madrid**, my much loved hometown. They are all either in the center of the city or within a short bus ride. There are a hell of a lot more good places and you will see that the city is very lively around socializing in bars and restaurants, and above all night life.

<div class="gmail_quote"><div class="gmail_quote">1. My favorite restaurant to eat traditional typical food (like my grandma would cook it) is **[Casa Ciriaco](http://www.fra.cityvox.es/restaurants_madrid/casa-ciriaco_1872/Profil-Lieu)** (C/ Mayor 84.)
2. The best fried cod tapas in Madrid are served at?? **[La Revuelta](http://11870.com/pro/casa-revuelta)** (C/ Latoneros 3.)
3. For more modern tapas and very close to La Revuelta the best place is?? **[Casa Lucas](http://11870.com/pro/casa-lucas)** (Cava Baja 30 ). It is very lively around this street and the Cava Alta, especially on Sundaysâ€™ early afternoon. The area is known as **La Latina**.??
4. By Casa Lucas you will find a very good typical restaurant: **[Casa Lucio](http://11870.com/pro/casa-lucio)** (Cava Baja 35.)
5. Not in the center but excellent for quality Gallician food is the restaurant **[Pazo Coru??a](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?oe=utf-8&rls=com.ubuntu:fr-BE:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=restaurante+gallego+retiro+madrid&fb=1&hq=restaurante+gallego+retiro&hnear=madrid&cid=10506642341174069225)** (C/ de P??o Baroja, 6). It is fully worth the trip, but watch out for their enormous servings.
6. For the truly greasy, cheap and excellent experience which is also?? typical from Madrid you should try the **fried calamari sandwiches** served in the bars located in the alleys that lead to the Plaza Mayor.
7. Thereâ€™s a new tapas and wine space with many different stands In the old market [**Mercado de San Miguel**](http://www.mercadodesanmiguel.es/) (Pza. de San Miguel), right by Plaza Mayor.
8. For an extraordinary *cocido* (Madridâ€™s chick-pea casserole) and not far from the center you should go to [**La Daniela**](http://11870.com/pro/taberna-la-daniela) (C/ General Pardi??as 21). Donâ€™t try this if you are not hungry!??
9. A good andalousian and traditional wine bar is [**La Venencia**](http://www.frommers.com/destinations/madrid/N26328.html) (C/ Echegaray 7) Thereâ€™s not much to eat, except for Mojama and fried almonds, but you can taste excellent Fino and Manzanilla wines among others while getting a taste of what the old Madrid was like.
10. For excellent paellas and other rice dishes, **[Arroceria Casa de Valenca](http://lacasavalencia.es/)** is a the best (Paseo del Pintor Rosales 58).

If you have time and can read Spanish, I recommend taking a look at the [Madrid Tapasâ€™ Guide by Pisto y Nopisto](http://www.pistoynopisto.com/index.php/2005/03/31/de_tapas_por_madrid) (a refined eating and drinking blog) and this [very complete tapas guide](http://www.scribd.com/doc/4934459/Tapas-en-Madrid).

Enjoy my top 10 and your time in Madrid ðŸ™‚
