Part of the challenge of having goals and deadlines is tracking them and being able to see your project’s progress. To help me out I’m working on [this scorecard](https://ramonsuarez.com/scorecard/) that tracks the [main goals and tactics](https://ramonsuarez.com/my-vision-and-plan/) of each [12 Week Year](https://ramonsuarez.com/12-week-year-summary-and-review/).

I’ve scoured the Internet for some templates to use and my scorecard is based on the [spreadsheet created by Carrie Dils](https://carriedils.com/book-review-the-12-week-year/).

This is what the current [scorecard looks like](https://ramonsuarez.com/scorecard/):

I’ve now included [my scorecard in this page](https://ramonsuarez.com/scorecards/).

This is not where I track all my tasks, this is where I keep track of the three main goals for the quarter and of the tactics to reach them. I use a task manager, a productivity journal, and my email to track tasks.

Another thing I’m doing is adding some data to my calendar (e.g. [strategic blocks](https://ramonsuarez.com/12-week-year-summary-and-review/)).

I would appreciate your help to make it easier to enter the data and not make mistakes. This is something that I want to release in the future to make it easy for others to implement their plans. If you use Airtable, do you think it can be imported there and use a form enter the data?

Thanks for your help!
