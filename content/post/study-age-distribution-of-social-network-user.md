It is worth a full read, but these are the **key-points** for me:

- The average social network user is 37 years old.
- The dominant age group is 35-44.
- 79% of users are older than 25 years old.
- The 18-24 years old group does not top any site

Iâ€™m sure the European aged distribution of social network users would not be far from this.

Hopefully this will definitely kill the *still-heard-off-belief* that social networking is for teenagers.
