Thanks to [Patrick Boostels](http://twitter.com/patrickbosteels "Patrick Bosteels in Twitter") I was given the chance to do the closing keynote presentation at **[DroidCon Belgium](http://www.droidcon.be/ "Droicon Belgium: all about Android mobiles") 2010** in Brussels, a one day event for Android developers, influencers and business people. I was only given day to create and prepare the full presentation. Talk about rush!</div><div>At least Patrick was kind enough to give me a good title to work from: **Ramon’s Vision**. I could speak freely about **my vision on the future of mobile and Android**, and so I did. After a full day talking applications and other very technical stuff (of which I don’t know enough to talk about) I decided to talk with the participants about what I thought was the most important factor for the development of mobile technologies: people.</div><div>**[Ramon’s Vision about the Future of Mobile (Droidcon Belgium 2010)](http://www.slideshare.net/ramonsuarez/ramons-vision-about-the-future-of-mobile-droidcon-belgium-2010 "Ramon's Vision about the Future of Mobile (Droidcon Belgium 2010)")** </div><div><div style="padding:5px 0 12px;">View more [presentations](http://www.slideshare.net/) from [Ramon Suarez](http://www.slideshare.net/ramonsuarez).</div><div style="padding:5px 0 12px;">Here’s the transcript of the presentation slides and the notes:</div>> <div style="padding:5px 0 12px;">**1.

<div style="padding:5px 0 12px;">Thanks to all the people that twitted and blogged good words about the presentation, they were more than I expected. In fact I was dreaming of upseting some Android developers enough to throw me their mobiles in anger (in the hopes of landing a new Nexus One), but I did not succeed.</div></div>
