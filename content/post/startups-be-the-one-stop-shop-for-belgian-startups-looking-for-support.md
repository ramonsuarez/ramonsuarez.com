If you follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/ramonsuarez "Coworking & Tech Entrepreneurship ") or any other social media account, Iâ€™m one of the founders and board members of [Startups.be](http://startups.be "Help for Belgian startups: support, guidance, money..."). It is an initiative Iâ€™ve been involved in for over a year, but only recently have we created the non profit organization. (Yes, I know it is hard to follow up on all the things I do, but you can always check my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/ramonsuarez "Ramon Suarez, coworking & tech entrepreneur ") to have an idea.)

The **purpose of Startups.be** is twofold:

- To **help tech starters** in Belgium to find help according to their needs, stage of growth and geographic location. It will be the one stop shop to find help and be redirected toward the right organizations.
- To **bring together all the entities that are working to help tech entrepreneurs** in the country. Thereâ€™s already 40 and we are working on bringing more people in.

The role of Startups.be is that of a **facilitator**, not a substitute.

We are currently working on the website, but you can already **[signup with your startup](http://www.startups.be/feature/register/ "register your startup in the Belgian directory of startups.be")** to be included in the **online directory of Belgian startups and to access more services** as they are implemented.

My colleague and driving force behind Startups.be, [Karen Boers](http://www.linkedin.com/in/karenboers "Karen Boers, the boss of startups.be"), was recently interviewed in [Trends Tendances](http://www.trends.be/ "Trends Tendances, Belgium's business magazine ") to present the project:

<div style="font-size:10px;text-align:center;width:100%">[View this document on Scribd](https://www.scribd.com/doc/148966299)Both the [Betagroup](http://betagroup.be "Startup Presentation & Networking in Belgium & Brussels") and [Betacowork](http://www.betacowork.com "Best coworking space in Brussels") are members of Startups.be, and so are [westartup](http://westartup.eu "Tech entrepreneurs social network in Europe"), [idealabs](http://idealabs.be/ "Startup accelerator in Gent"), [Webmission](http://www.webmission.be "Traveling Belgian tech entrepreneurs"), [iMinds](http://www.iminds.be), [ABE](http://www.abe-bao.be/ "Brussels Enterprise Agency"), [AWT](http://www.awt.be/ "Agence Wallone des Telecommunications"), and many others. The list is growing, and as you can see there are a lot of different sizes, types of organizations, private & publicâ€¦ Some, donâ€™t even exist as an organization! If you want to join, just [get in touch](http://www.startups.be/contact-us/ "Contact Startups.be") with Karen.

The board of directors is composed of entrepreneurs from the three regions: [Peter Hinssen](http://www.linkedin.com/in/phinssen), [Alain Heureux](http://www.linkedin.com/in/alainheureux), [Antoine Perdaens](http://www.linkedin.com/in/antoineperdaens), [Jurgen Ingels](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jurgen-ingels/0/521/356), [Sylvie Irzi](http://www.linkedin.com/in/sylvieirzi), and myself. Karen Boers is the Managing Director.

What Iâ€™ve liked from the begining is the willingness to work together, to overcome the regional compartmentalization of the country.

Some of the first actions where the Startups.be day, with a lot of organizations giving workshops and value to the starters, and the stand at LeWeb. Both were awesome ðŸ™‚
