There are several **alternatives to omnisio**:

- Use an online tool like **[Vcasmo](http://bit.ly/aXbIT0 "Vcasmo") or [Zentation](http://bit.ly/bvrUpA "Zentation").**
- Convert the presentation to images and then insert it in the video with a non-linear video editor (I use **[KDEnlive](http://www.kdenlive.org/ "KDEnlive free video editor for Mac and Linux")**, here you have a manual for **[Microsoft Produce](http://bit.ly/by7Yue "Microsoft Producer and PowerPoint howto")**r). This can be complicated, but it offers more control. Check this[ video tutorials](http://www.kdenlive.org/tutorial "KDEnlive video tutorials") to learn the basics.
