> Since [Facebook is where Americans spend more time than anywhere else on the Internet](http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9135551/Americans_spend_most_online_time_on_Facebook), our needs as social media marketers as well as professionals to stay on top of the latest trends in 2010 regarding the social media gorilla are as important as ever. While I limited my similar top blog posts on[ Twitter](http://windmillnetworking.com/2010/12/16/top-20-most-useful-twitter-blog-posts-of-2010/) and [LinkedIn](http://windmillnetworking.com/2010/12/21/top-20-most-useful-linkedin-blog-posts-of-2010/) to 20, so many people had so much resourceful information to provide on FB that I felt the need to expand this blog post to include the top *30* most useful articles this year. Because Facebook gives anyone the ability to create a mini-web site on their platform as a Page, I included many blog posts that talk about everything from how to create one, customize it, and then use it as your base for social media engagement.
> 
> You may wonder why I go through the trouble of compiling and writing these posts, but the answer is simple: Our industry is changing so fast and there are so many blog posts and tweets out there that I want to make sure to provide a guideline to my readers, and myself, of those must-read articles that will help everybody keep pace or get up-to-speed in learning about the latest thinking surrounding any given social media platform. The end-of-the-year is the perfect time to do this.
> 
> My algorithm for determining these blog posts is the same as previous ones, and once again I have tried my best to organize them into categories for you. Although I didn???t write as many posts about this site as I did about Twitter and LinkedIn, where appropriate I will introduce my own writings as well in case you missed them.
