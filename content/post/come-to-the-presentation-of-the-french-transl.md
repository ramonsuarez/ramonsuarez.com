>  <div class="paragraph editable-text" style="text-align:left;">The [Betagroup Coworking Brussels](http://coworking.betagroup.be/index.html) is proud to host the worlwide premiere of the brand new translation in French of the Lean Startup and Customer Development bible: **The** **Four Steps to the Epiphany**, now also known as [Les 4 ??tapes vers l’??piphanie](http://www.amiando.com/leanstartupbe.html).When [Antoine Bruyns](http://antoinebruyns.com/) contacted us, we knew instantly that we had to do it. He’s an example of the kind of entrepreneurial individual that makes things happen: he contacted [Steve Blank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Gary_Blank) and offered to do the translation. Then, he has spent a lot of hours after his job to help with the promotion of this concepts in French. Don’t let the title misslead you, this book synthesizes the **basic steps to bring a product to market**, nothing to do with religion.
