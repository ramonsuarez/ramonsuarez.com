As part of the [challenge to launch at least one project/business a month](http://ramonsuarez.com/launching-at-least-one-project-every-month-my-entrepreneurship-learning-challenge/), I’m going to share here what goes well and what doesn’t. As my good friend and entrepreneur [Xavier Corman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xaviercorman/) has pointed out, I have to have clear KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and I think that those KPIs should be public. So here they are:

- 10 coworking space pages published following the [guidelines](https://www.coworking.space/how-to/).
- And then 30 by Friday.

If I don’t see enough traction I will keep the site running but stop promoting it. It will be in the backburner until I decide on something else to do with it (I already have a few ideas but would love to hear from you).

If you want to be updated on the next steps, [give me your email](https://ramonsuarez.com/do-you-want-to-hear-from-me/).
