</div><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via [bvlg.blogspot.com](http://bvlg.blogspot.com/)</div>[Bruno Peeters](http://twitter.com/bvlg) has crawled the Belgian twitosphere to get some insight about it. He has produced a very interesting infographic extrapolating data from over 46000 Twitter accounts located in Belgium.

The average Twitter account in Belgium follows 90 Twitter users, is followed by 87, is listed 4,5 times, and has tweeted 378 times.

Out of an estimate of 75.000 to 100.000 accounts, 32% Tweet weekly and 18% have no activity at all.

Iâ€™m looking forward to more information coming from Bruno about what is going on in this country. Thank you Bruno!
