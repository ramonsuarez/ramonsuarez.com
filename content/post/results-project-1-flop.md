The launch of [coworking.space](https://www.coworking.space) has been a flop. The first [KPI](https://ramonsuarez.com/next-weeks-kpis-for-coworking-space/) is far from being fulfilled. 18 spaces signed up but almost none of them edited their landing page. The first one that did, completely ignored the [guidelines](https://www.coworking.space/how-to/) and did not even include a link to their site even after telling them about it. The only coworking space that followed the guidelines was [Betacowork](https://betacowork.coworking.space), my former coworking space (where I still work 1 to 3 days a week), and with a lot of help from me.

None of the help offers nor the requests for feedback where responded to.

This is a strong signal that there’s no interest in this iteration of coworking.space. The directory of landing pages is not relevant.

I still think there’s a lot to do to solve the **main problem of coworking spaces: sales.**

As my friend Ash says, **[love the problem not your solution](https://blog.leanstack.com)**.

I’m stopping work in this iteration of coworking.space but will keep on trying to find solutions that can be helpful to bring more business to coworking spaces around the world.

What I’ve Learned
-----------------

- How to whitelist a URL in Facebook.
- How to use my main GSuite account to send and receive emails with multiple URLs (like the one of this blog)
- How to setup emails with GSuite and WordPress to use my OVH domain.
- How to setup a WordPress multisite.
- How to auto update WordPress plugins with one line of code.
- Bits and pieces of WordPress. customization and use of plugins.

Next Project
------------

The next project in the [challenge](https://ramonsuarez.com/launching-at-least-one-project-every-month-my-entrepreneurship-learning-challenge/) will be a short one to activate some of the thousands of emails in my mailbox and segment them based on their [interests](https://ramonsuarez.com/do-you-want-to-hear-from-me/). More on this in the next post.
