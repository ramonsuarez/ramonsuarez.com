**[Jini](http://getjini.com "smartphone artificial intelligence assistant")** is an application for smartphones that proactively sugests you things to do based on other applications usage (like RunKeeper) and the sensor information from your phone (location, speed, light…)

Filip Maertens is the founder of this Belgian startup that can really change our mobile world. A good example of what Jini does: when he arrived to Paris to present at the Startup competition at LeWeb, Jini sugested a route to go jogging close to his hotel.

They are also building an API and SDK so that other developers can tap on Jini’s intelligence to offer even more useful services.

They are **my favourite startup to win the competition at LeWeb.**
