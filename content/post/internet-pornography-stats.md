Numerique is dedicated to Internet porn](http://www.cafenumerique.be/2010/06/01/le-porno-en-ligne-au-cafe-numerix/): a controversial business that is usually refferred to as one of the main engines of innovation and development of the Internet itself. I’am curious to see what they will bring out in their presentation, beyond the discussion about copyright and P2P issues.
