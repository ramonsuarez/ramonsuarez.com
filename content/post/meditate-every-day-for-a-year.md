**Meditation has had a profound positive impact in my life**. Being more aware is bringing a lot of improvements to my actions and feelings. **It has improved my work, my personal relationships and my sport practice**. I enjoy the [benefits](https://www.headspace.com/science/meditation-benefits) of awareness/mindfulness meditation.

I started meditating in 2015 with a book and it was okayish, but when I started using the HeadSpace app I really felt the difference. After doing the fist 10 sessions I noticed that something had already changed in me.

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe allowfullscreen="true" class="youtube-player" height="360" loading="lazy" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t_yXe_6mYTA?version=3&rel=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&fs=1&hl=en-US&autohide=2&wmode=transparent" style="border:0;" width="640"></iframe></span>

Since then Iâ€™ve been meditating on and off, tried other apps (none of them really worked for me), never really making a full week. I thought of it as yet another thing to do, an extra task and burden on my day, even though I know it has a lot of benefits for me. I even completely stopped for a while when I was burned out.

For the last few months Iâ€™ve been meditating more often, regularly but not daily. Now **Iâ€™ve decided to meditate every day**. I hope this will become like brushing my teeth, something I do every day automatically, without even thinking, and that I canâ€™t leave the house without doing it.

To help me succeed (and start the day with a success that motivates me and sets a positive mood) Iâ€™ve set 7 am as my meditation time. My sonâ€™s alarm is set for 7h15, and this way I have just enough time to do a 10 minute meditation. If I cannot get to do it then (babies and little kids do not follow very regular schedules), I do it as soon as I can. It can be a walking meditation, a commuting standing meditation, or the first thing I do when I arrive to the coworking space I work at (directly at my desk, I donâ€™t mind the people in the room). My objective is not doing a number of minutes per day, but to do it every day. Some days Iâ€™ll do multiple meditation sessions, other days Iâ€™ll do a very short one. **Meditation has to work for me, not me for meditation**.

Iâ€™ve been also using a password for my computers to ingrain it in my brain, reminding me that I meditate every day. Changing my password every few weeks is a nice hack to help me get some stuff done and to do some psychological preparation for [my sport](https://www.olympicpistol.com).

The app reminders are helpful when I cannot meditate in the morning not to forget, but they donâ€™t really entice me to meditate.

So far Iâ€™ve managed to meditate for 44 days in a row. My objective is to make it to a full year, but in the meantime I set myself shorter term objectives, like getting to 50, 75, 90â€¦

What Iâ€™m struggling with is remembering to do the mindful moments during the day. Iâ€™m just too focused on whatever Iâ€™m doing and forget about it.

The first 10 meditations are free anyway. Other apps that people use are [Calm](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.calm.android) (free) and [MÃ©diter avec Petit BamBou](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.petitbambou) (in French, also free).

Try them all and see which one suits you best. I prefer Andyâ€™s voice ðŸ™‚
