> **If you promote it they might come**. You could be writing the most fantastic blog on earth but if no one knows about it why bother? It’s almost like the old saying, “If a tree falls in the woods and no one is there to hear it, did it make a sound?

via [dailyblogtips.com](http://www.dailyblogtips.com/top-5-blogging-misconceptions/)</div>The product vs promotion dilemma that is encountered in a lot of business. Building/creating/writing a great product does not mean anybody will care about it. Without promotion it is dead.
