I’m struggling with what to do about my knowledge of coworking and the assets I’ve built about it.

![](/uploads/2019/03/ruminating.gif)</div>I know I can help a lot and that my knowledge is useful to a lot of founders and staff of coworking spaces (thanks for the feedback!).

At the same time I cannot help but think that I’m trying too much to develop coworking related projects. There’s this inner struggle between turning the page and forgetting about it, and using these assets to build some side projects and sources of income.

[My coworking book](https://www.coworkinghandbook.com) is something I’m proud of, that is helping a lot of people, and that is [still bringing some revenue every month](https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/moving-beyond-self-doubt-to-write-a-handbook-grossing-over-50k-eae5f6ebab). In fact it has brought way more than I ever thought it would. I feel obliged to promote it and improve the website to capture more traffic and to convert better, to keep up the sales. I see it as a great opportunity to apply all that I’m learning about SEO, automation and online sales.

At the same time, I can’t help but feel pressured by the people that (with great intentions) keep on telling me to do coworking stuff and monetize my reputation and knowledge. After all it took me a while to establish my authority in the field and to create the content that drives organic traffic to the Coworking Handbook site. Heck, I’m one of them!

It is like if was stuck into it forever, and I hate feeling stuck.

Part of me understands my coworking value and some of the potential, but another part of me wants to move on and flip the page.

I cannot help to think if, in this case, I’m a solution in search of a problem.

And it sucks.
