*[Don’t miss any of my adventures as a Jedi entrepreneur](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSerPrYxhHkx55PoPtZrKvolDDw5Q-sMc5akSpWP4j0SxsjmzA/viewform)*

Since the public launch of [coworking.space](https://www.coworking.space) last week (and of my [entrepreneurship challenge](http://ramonsuarez.com/launching-at-least-one-project-every-month-my-entrepreneurship-learning-challenge/)) I’ve been ramping up the promotion of the service to try to get more spaces in via Facebook groups and pages, [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoWorking/comments/9pj5xt/free_directory_and_websites_for_coworking_spaces/), email and some advertising. My post to the [coworking Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/coworking) is held for moderation.

Sign-ups
--------

So far **18 spaces have** **[signed up](https://www.coworking.space/add/)**… but only one has drafted the listing following the [guidelines](https://www.coworking.space/how-to/) and with help from me: [Betacowork Coworking Brussels](https://betacowork.coworking.space).

I’ve sent a few messages offering one on one help and also to organize a conf call, but the users are not getting back to me. My guess is that they don’t see the value and that they just signed up because it is free.

Just in case, on top of the guidelines and the emails new users get, I’ve added items to the top menu to make it more helpful. Originally I just wanted to have one link there to help visitors focus on the landing page, but the top bar is common to all, also to the people that are adding listings.

I even left it grey, a color I hate for text, to hide it a bit. Maybe I should be more blunt.

When there are enough spaces to publish the directory I’ll have to look into a new homepage and navigation.

On the side of the [one project a month challenge](http://ramonsuarez.com/launching-at-least-one-project-every-month-my-entrepreneurship-learning-challenge/), 10 people have [signed up](https://ramonsuarez.com/do-you-want-to-hear-from-me/) to follow up on what I do.

reddit’s r/coworking
--------------------

The [coworking forum on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoWorking/) has very little action in general. I’m not sure that many people read it, but at least my posts are published right away.

Anyway, if you have an account I would appreciate an [up vote](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoWorking/comments/9pj5xt/free_directory_and_websites_for_coworking_spaces/).

Facebook Ads
------------

Facebook ads have driven almost no traffic to the site, but I did get some likes on the post and I’ve invited those people to like the page.

I’ve stopped that campaign, duplicated it and relaunched it for the USA only, to see what happens.

After the email I sent this morning to seventy some people in the mailing list, tomorrow will be a big day to see if there’s any traction, but so far it does not look so good for [Wednesday’s KPI](http://ramonsuarez.com/next-weeks-kpis-for-coworking-space/).

I was hoping that this campaign would solve the issue I have with Facebook flagging my coworking.space links as malicious (I’ve tried to get it fixed but can’t get far). No luck with the link but they do charge me. I guess they do not like dot space domains.

Tracking Marketing Efforts
--------------------------

As part of my challenge to be more structured, I’m keeping a spreadsheet with what I’ve been doing since Friday. I’m not sure I have set the right headings and content, but at least I’ve made it very easy to go back to each action.
