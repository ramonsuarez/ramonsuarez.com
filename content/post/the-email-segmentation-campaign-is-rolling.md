The [email segmentation &amp; reactivation campaign](http://ramonsuarez.com/dipping-my-toes-into-email-marketing-automation/) to freshen up my mailing lists is set up and rolling.

Choosing the Right Tool and Cleaning Up Contacts
------------------------------------------------

I dropped Mautic for being too complicated and awful to clean up contacts (the main problem I have with all the CRM Iâ€™ve tried so far). At the end I went for a much easier set up with the help of a [Google add-on](https://digitalinspiration.com/#addons) by [Amit Argawal](https://digitalinspiration.com/google-developer). I had already used his [Gmail Extractor](https://digitalinspiration.com/product/email-address-extractor) to build the list with all the email addresses in my inbox.

I ended up with over 90.000 emails in the spreadsheet. Then I de-duplicated them and sent them to a list verification service for some cleanup (sorry but I cannot find the exact one I used, try [this list](https://www.capterra.com/email-verification-tools-software/) to find one). I ended up with over 22.000 emails, but I still had to do a lot of cleanup manually.

First I tried with Mautic, but after many hours of hard work I decided to give up. I could not even do a reset of the contacts and delete them all at once to upload a cleaned list from Google Contacts or a cleaned spreadsheet, so I decided to delete the account and look for something simpler and to clean up the contacts in a spreadsheet using filters. Luckily Iâ€™ve made a list of words to use that Iâ€™ve been improving with each cleanup.

At the end I used [Mail Merge](https://digitalinspiration.com/product/gmail-mail-merge) by Amit, which is very easy to use (although he fails to reply to support questions).

Email Copy
----------

Initially I had thought of an overly complicated email that had too many choices:

![](/uploads/2018/11/email-segmentation-note-keep.png)

I kept the original idea but made it (hopefully) simpler. This is the current email template:

> Hi {{First Name}}
> 
> *Sorry if this message pops up out of the blue (donâ€™t worry, there wonâ€™t be a second email).*
> 
> As part of my entrepreneurship challenge Iâ€™m refreshing my network and just went through my inbox to get the email addresses of everybody Iâ€™ve been in touch with in the last few years.
> 
> You may know me as the founder of Betacowork, author of The Coworking Handbook, and organizer of startups.be, Betagroup, Startup weekend Brussels and other initiatives. Iâ€™ve organized a lot of events about entrepreneurship, coworking and many other subjects in Brussels that you have probably attended.

>

> 
> [linkedin.com/in/ramonsuarez/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramonsuarez/?utm_source=listbuilder&utm_medium=email)

To me it looks too wordy still, but I thought that it was good enough to send. It includes information to help people understand why Iâ€™m contacting them, remember who I am, and understand how I got their email.

Sending Emails Out
------------------

This was a strange week to start sending emails out with the long weekends and vacations, but I think that it is better to be out than to be perfect.

The first two batches where of 50 emails each. 10% have bounced. No complains, no signups.

Today I sent 100 more and got 17% bounces. I saw the email of one of my friends passing by, so I contacted him to see how he got the email. It all looks good:

He did sign up, but I would not use this as a signal.

I can send up to 1500 emails a day, but Iâ€™m holding the horses because of fear of getting flagged as a spammer. I have not been able to see how to limit the daily send, so Iâ€™ve contacted Amit (he never got back to me). Hopefully heâ€™ll help me figure it out. Right now I have to launch the script manually every day and I want to just launch it and forget about it.

Next Steps
----------

Next thing to do is to set up the queries in the [suscription spreadsheet](https://ramonsuarez.com/do-you-want-to-hear-from-me/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post) to be able to use [automate.io](https://automate.io) or [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) to add everyone to the right mail-list automatically. This is part of my [challenge](https://ramonsuarez.com/challenge-projects/) and of the [things I want to learn and improve through practice](https://ramonsuarez.com/things-to-learn-and-improve-through-practice/).

Do you have any suggestions?
