via [benitocastro.com](http://www.benitocastro.com/tengo-que-escribir-un-post-una-reflexion-de-p)It has been a while since my last post here (Iâ€™ve been active in my [Spanish blog about Brussels](http://www.blogbruselas.com)). Nothing better than this cartoon to showcase one of the many facets of the strugle to post: while many times we are enthusiastic and easily post about many things we find, a lot of other times we just think it is a waste of effort.

The inner fight that many times stops some great fresh posts to see the light of the screen.
