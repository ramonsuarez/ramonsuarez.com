He gave a terrific talk about [customer development](http://market-by-numbers.com/customer-development/) and lean startup methodology.

You guys missed a great talk. In 15 minutes Brant was able to motivate and help the participants more than some business courses can do in a semester. Inspiring, practical and funny.

The best way to kickstart Startup Weekend Brussels, live from sunny San Diego.
