Are you planning to launch your own startup? This presentation by Adeo Ressi can help you do the basic market research

What market are you pursuing? Is it big enough? Is it growing or shrinking? What are the other characteristics of your market, and why do you care? How do you find data on your market? How do you define your competitors? What are inexpensive tactics to do custom market research? How can you determine if you can win in your target market, and when do you decide to walk away? This is part of the Founder Institute startup incubation and acceleration program, also happening in [Brussels](http://www.founderinstitute.com/courses/639).
