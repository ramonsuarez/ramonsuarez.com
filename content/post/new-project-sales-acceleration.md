I’ve taken a few weeks off to enjoy the summer break with my family and to think about the [challenge](https://ramonsuarez.com/launching-at-least-one-project-every-month-my-entrepreneurship-learning-challenge/). A lot of doubts have assaulted my head and heart, mainly regarding the validity of my approach and what to do next.

If you are reading [my emails](https://ramonsuarez.com/do-you-want-to-hear-from-me/), you know that I’ve struggled a bit with this. Part of my struggles has to do with a repeating yearly happening: seasonal affective disorder. Every end of summer, starting in the second half of August, my brain and body chemistry get unbalanced and I have a mood change that makes me be more insecure. Luckily it is much lighter than it ever has been, but I still have to remember that it is there and to fight it. Talking to other entrepreneurs helps, and my mastermind helps even more because it is like a positive fire under my butt telling me to move.

![](https://i1.wp.com/ramonsuarez.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Running-away-from-doubt.jpg?fit=1000%2C1000&ssl=1)The projects have been a success in terms of taking them on and carrying them out, but I don’t think I’ve done a good work promoting them, so I decided to spend the next three weeks working on marketing:

1. [The BIGF Method (Business Idea Generation Framework)](https://www.bigfmethod.com)
2. [The Coworking Community Course](https://courses.coworkinghandbook.com/course/coworking-community-challenge/)
3. [The Coworking Handbook](https://www.coworkinghandbook.com)

The priority is based on what I want to do more and what has more potential.

The promotion of the Coworking Handbook will probably ride on the efforts of promoting the community course. If I have time left, I will try also to improve the promotion of the [Target Shooting Journal](https://www.olympicpistol.com/target-shooting-journal-paperback-and-pdf/).

What I need to do is to get back into my marketing and selling shoes and add velocity to them And that is exactly what I’m going to do. I’ve been too focused on product and have lost touch with the part of me that loves doing the promotion and helping out. Time to accelerate.
