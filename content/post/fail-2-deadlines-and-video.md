![](/uploads/2019/01/fail.gif)</div>The end of 2018 has not been good for my [challenge](https://ramonsuarez.com/challenge-projects/). I’ve stalled with the creation of the [video course](https://ramonsuarez.com/new-project-coworking-course/) and kept on extending a deadline that was just too soft. Here’s the recap of what I’ve learned and what comes next.

Deadlines need to be precise
----------------------------

My first mistake when I launched the video course project was not to set a precise deadline. One month from now is not good enough, I need to have a date and time and keep it visible. I can then also prepare a timeline of the project and evaluate my progress towards it in chunks not just for the completion of the whole course.

Chunking progress
-----------------

Having only one result to measure (the completion of the whole course) makes it harder to be conscious of progress, as it is always lacking. I should have defined smaller chunks of the project that where relevant and conducive to the result and that would have kept me on track.

For example, I did all the courses available in Udemy concerning how to make good courses (very helpful) and took notes that I used to work on my own course. I also read all the available documentation they had and checked all their files (mostly templates). I’ve also prepared 139 great slides full of content and with a lot of helpful exercises and tasks.

Video lessons are hard
----------------------

I did not think this would be a problem but it is. Speaking in public is not an issue for me; I’m used to giving interviews on radio and TV, conferences to hundreds of people and live streamed, courses… You name it.

<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe allowfullscreen="true" class="youtube-player" height="360" loading="lazy" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sYqqrr5bFEo?version=3&rel=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&fs=1&hl=en-US&autohide=2&wmode=transparent" style="border:0;" width="640"></iframe></span></div>I’m not afraid of doing it and I’m used to prepare conferences with just a few main points that I can even update right before a conference based on what other speakers are saying. I feel at ease, but with these lessons it was just the opposite: I froze.

The problem may come from the courses about making courses themselves: I got into my mind that I have to be super precise and perfect, which I’m not. I tried writing scripts and discovered that I’ve forgotten how to read aloud. The few times I tried was awful. I felt paralyzed, hesitant, with no confidence at all. It sucked.

Too big an MVP
--------------

I started with the [coworking community course](https://www.coworkinghandbook.com/coworking-community-course-draft/) because it is smaller than the sales course I want to do. I thought that the MVP was to do a first online video course, but this has proven to be way too big.

I have to start with something smaller that does not demand so many hours of work on each video.

Online != Video
---------------

Online courses are not necessarily video courses. I have a lot of good written content and can easily produce more. I’m good at writing. Why impose video on myself? This has multiplied the load of work.

Next steps
----------

I’m still going to do the course, but right now I’m exploring how to make it a text based course. I’m researching tools to try to do it as easy as possible on myself to launch and get feedback while providing a hell of a lot of value to the students.

The course is taking shape more like a workbook, with tasks that help improve the community of coworking spaces while the course is ongoing, not only at the end.

I want to improve my project management and I will test using [OKR (objectives and key results)](https://amzn.to/2ssdiKh) even if it is just for myself. This book has made me think a lot about it:

[![](/uploads/2019/01/measure-what-matters-okr.jpg)](https://amzn.to/2ssdiKh)So this week I will be reviewing my notes and making myself a guide on how to implement OKR for the next project.

Next deadline : 21/1
--------------------

This week I will take time to think about my next projects and deadlines and to get a better idea of the effort involved and tools needed. In the morning of Monday 21 I will publish a post with the next project, its deadline and a timeline.
