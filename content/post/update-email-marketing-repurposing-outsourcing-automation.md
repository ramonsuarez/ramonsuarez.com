Another busy and motivating week has just gone by and things are looking good. Here is this weekâ€™s [progress report](https://ramonsuarez.com/category/projects/progress-report/).

As Ash Maurya says:

> [Practice Trumps Theory](https://twitter.com/ashmaurya/status/877724575387324416)

One of the main reasons for the [entrepreneurship challenge](http://ramonsuarez.com/launching-at-least-one-project-every-month-my-entrepreneurship-learning-challenge/) is to get my hands dirty and it is working wonders.

Revamping Network and Mailing Lists
-----------------------------------

So far [1479 emails](http://ramonsuarez.com/the-email-segmentation-campaign-is-rolling/) of the [segmentation project](http://ramonsuarez.com/dipping-my-toes-into-email-marketing-automation/) have gone out. The few responses Iâ€™m getting are extremely positive and Iâ€™ve had my first meeting thanks to it today. I know more about what some people are doing and is super interesting. Computer assisted networking FTW!

Only 10 people have signed up via the [interest form ](http://ramonsuarez.com/do-you-want-to-hear-from-me/)to hear back from me, but this blog is getting some more views (nothing crazy though)

On the down side, there are a lot of bad emails (maybe I validated the list too long ago, or the service was not that good), but so far no problems with deliverability. Iâ€™ve not dared to let go 1500 emails per day yet, but will probably do next week.

Repurposing: Lead Magnets
-------------------------

Iâ€™ve made a list of 44 pieces of content to use as lead magnets and get more relevant emails. You can check the [list here](https://ramonsuarez.com/category/projects/progress-report/). Hurry before I put it behind a form and you have to give me your email ðŸ™‚

They are separated by property and can be ordered by priority. Some of the [Olympic Pistol](https://www.olympicpistol.com) documents are set to low priority because they already exist, ugly but available. I will probably improve them with outsourced help.

Outsourcing via Fiverr
----------------------

Iâ€™ve ordered two times the same infographic about the [Advantages of Coworking](https://www.coworkinghandbook.com/advantages-benefits-coworking-list/) on [Fiverr](http://www.fiverr.com/s2/6024be1e4a). This is part of the first one Iâ€™ve received (still under revision), for which I paid $32.50: ![](/uploads/2018/11/teaser-advantages-coworking-handbook-1024x394.png)

Iâ€™ve also ordered close to a hundred [Pinterest](https://pin.it/kcxsdnuxjohdmi) quotes from my [coworking book](https://www.coworkinghandbook.com/). Iâ€™m curious about using Instagram to drive traffic to my posts and if including Instagram optimized images in my posts will result in more social shares.

Total expense so far is $62.50 including all of Fiverrâ€™s commissions.

Iâ€™ve taken advantage of this first test to bookmark a bunch of profiles for the next orders.

Automation
----------

Iâ€™ve not managed to find the tool to manage all lead magnets and subscriptions in one place. Right now Iâ€™m working with a mix of [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/), [ automate.io](https://automate.io)and [Mailchimp](http://eepurl.com/dM3QvU).

This week I have created a few new bots with [automate.io](https://automate.io) to send the new signups from people that want to hear from me to the relevant [Mailchimp](http://eepurl.com/dM3QvU) list, but I have not turned them on yet. Iâ€™m missing running a test with [Google Sheets queries](https://www.benlcollins.com/spreadsheets/google-sheets-query-sql/).

The lead magnets I started adding to my [olympic pistol blog](https://www.olympicpistol.com) four weeks ago have brought in 256 signups in a site that has only gotten 519 unique visitors in the last 30 days. This is great.

Gotta go train now. Make sure you tune in on Monday to learn about the [next challenge](http://ramonsuarez.com/challenge-projects/). Enjoy the weekend!
