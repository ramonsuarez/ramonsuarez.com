TL;DR: Because it does not matter.

After 227 days (almost seven and a half months) of daily meditation I missed one day, which broke the challenge I had set up for myself of [meditating everyday for a year](https://ramonsuarez.com/meditate-every-day-for-a-year/). The people at Headspace kindly reset the counter so that the streak would not be broken when I asked them how many days I had meditated in a row, but this did not change the fact that I had missed a day.

This reset was bugging me, because it was a lie.

And then last Sunday I missed another one which made it much easier to confront questions like does it matter and is it a flop or a win.

The truth is that it does not matter. Using the [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) app, plus calendar reminders in conjunction with the challenge has been a success in making meditation a daily practice, something that is integrated into my routine.

I have issues with the days that break the routine (usually when there are holidays or days of the weekend with no regular alone time) but missing a day here and there does not really matter when I take into account that I have meditated a lot since December 6 2018 and [gotten a lot out of it](https://ramonsuarez.com/meditated-for-100-days/).

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](/uploads/2019/05/image.png)</figure>On top of this, Iâ€™ve meditated outside of the Headspace app too. In fact in every competition I do meditation exercises and I donâ€™t need the app to do any of the meditations. Iâ€™ve learned a lot and remember enough to be autonomous, although I still enjoy and use the app.

Iâ€™ve succeeded in making mediation work for me like I set myself to do, and thatâ€™s what really matters, not an external sign of recognition in the form of a badge. The fact is that meditation has helped me see the futility of the one year goal ðŸ™‚

> Thank you for your reply and Iâ€™m happy to see that you are going to continue your practice without focusing on the run streak so much. Thatâ€™s really the goal here, the run streak is used more for the beginning of your journey as a helpful motivation tool to go into the app each day. The hope is that you wonâ€™t feel the need to have this run streak in order to keep your practice going, that youâ€™ll be able to apply the techniques to your daily life without even realizing it.
