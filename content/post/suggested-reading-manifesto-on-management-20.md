Management 2.0 is about rethinking radically the way companies and more generally organizations are being managed; from the way they manage suppliers, to the employment relationships they build, to how they design their products and services, to the support they offer to customers, to the influence they exert, to how they relate to the world and their local communities… It’s about more than just enterprise 2.0 seen through the narrow lens of cool AJAX applications with wikis, blogs and sharing functionality. **Management 2.0 is about symbiotic relationships between adult humans at work.
