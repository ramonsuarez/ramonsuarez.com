**[TUZZit](http://tuzzit.com/ "TUZZit online project management tool ")** is a very promising online project management tool that focuses in ease of use and visual appeal. There are no save buttons and it allows to present ideas and task just like we would do in a whiteboard, with a visual organization instead of a date or alphabet based presentation.

When Christophe Fruyter showed it to me at the [Belgian Startups stand at LeWeb](http://ramonsuarez.com/belgian-startups-at-leweb12-aka-beleweb), I inmediately thought of [CheckThis](http://www.checkthis.com/ "internet posters"), the online tool to publish your internet posters. Both are very product oriented and focused on the user experience. They want to make their use easy and appealing.

Christophe is launching his startup from the south of Belgium, and has a developing global ambition.
