After the launch of my [email campaign to refresh my network](http://ramonsuarez.com/the-email-segmentation-campaign-is-rolling/), I â€˜ve decided to continue building on my skills and focus on three of the [things I want to improve](http://ramonsuarez.com/things-to-learn-and-improve-through-practice/):

- Repurposing content.
- Outsourcing some of my work.
- Automate as much as possible.

Repurposing
-----------

I have produced a lot of content, be it in the form of blog posts, books, conferences, social media sharesâ€¦ A lot of it is evergreen content (content that is good forever, that does not go bad after a certain date). I want to repurpose some of this content to produce other formats like infographics and presentations.

This is not the first time Iâ€™ve done this. If you follow some of my social media accounts (*[T](https://twitter.com/ramonsuarez)*[witter](https://twitter.com/ramonsuarez), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ramonsuarezdotcom), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramonsuarez/), [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/ramonsuarez/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/ramonsuarezv)â€¦) you have seen articles reposted with different text in the post and quotes from my [coworking book](https://www.coworkinghandbook.com/?utm_source=ramonsuarez.com&utm_medium=post).

Some of this content will be given away in exchange of an email to help build my mail lists.

Outsourcing
-----------

A lot of this content can be made more visual to appeal to different audiences, be shared more and bring in new traffic. Iâ€™m a words person, not an images person, so Iâ€™m going to outsource as much as I can.

The first platform Iâ€™m going to test is [Fiverr](http://www.fiverr.com/s2/6024be1e4a), and the first job is going to be to make an infographic out of my post about the [advantages of coworking.](https://www.coworkinghandbook.com/advantages-benefits-coworking-list/)

Automation
----------

There are too many tasks where I donâ€™t add any value and that can be automated:

1. Posting the repurposed and recurring content.
2. Adding people to mailing lists.
3. Sending specific content based on the form submitted.
4. Launching drip campaigns to provide and get value
5. Browser macros to delete contacts from CRMsâ€¦

Luckily I already have some experience with the first three, but I want to improve it by using new tools instead of hacking away with Google Forms and automate.io.

Can you help with any of these? Got questions? Use the comment section below this post ðŸ™‚
