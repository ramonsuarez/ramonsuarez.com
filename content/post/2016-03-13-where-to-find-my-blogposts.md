This blog has been a abandoned for a while because of my engagements with coworking and startups with different organizations. I still publish blog-posts in these blogs:

- **[Coworking Handbook](http://coworkinghandbook.com/blog/)**: Iâ€™ve been more active in the creation of pages full of **[resources for coworking spaces](http://coworkinghandbook.com/resources/)**.
- **[Betacowork Coworking Brussels](http://www.betacowork.com/fr/author/ramonsuarez/):** My coworking space full of starters &amp; freelancers. The best place to work on earth ðŸ™‚
- [Loogic](http://loogic.com/author/ramonsuarez/): the best Spanish speaking blog about startups. Iâ€™m not attending conferences any more and if I do I just concentrate in talking to people, so I have not published anything in a long while.
- [Blog Bruselas](http://www.blogbruselas.com/blog/author/admin/): my first blog devoted to my passion about Brussels, people and food. Abandoned.
