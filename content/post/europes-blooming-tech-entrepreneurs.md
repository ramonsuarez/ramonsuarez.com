via [economist.com](http://www.economist.com/node/16317551)</div>The Economist has published a very interesting article on the blooming tech entrepreneur sceene in Europe and the main differences with the USA.

The two things that struck me the most were:??

- The seed and start-up venture capital structure in Europe.
- The shocking list of the barriers to entrepreneurship index made by the OECD. Italy, Spain and Sweden have lower barriers than the USA.

It has also left me thinking about the Venture Capital divide.

Great food for thought.
