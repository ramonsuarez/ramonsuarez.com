<div class="posterous_quote_citation">via [dailyblogtips.com](http://www.dailyblogtips.com/top-5-blogging-misconceptions/)</div>The product vs promotion dilemma that is encountered in a lot of business. Building/creating/writing a great product does not mean anybody will care about it. Without promotion it is dead.

Unfortunately, we get bombarded all the time with unnecessary, irrelevant and useless products. But it proves the point: because of the promotion they thrive (not necessarily survive a long time or be considered a success.)

I specially appreciated the ***might***, after all in marketing and communication *it all depends*.
