This blog has been abandoned for some time because I thought that some other blogs I had were more relevant for what I wanted to write. But it has been nagging me all the time.

This is the best outlet for my personal thinking, and for a while it was also a kind of web scrapbook (I miss you Posterous). This blog is more about Ramon and his many interests, about ideas, thoughts and doubts. About new ventures and adventures.

I also made the learning mistake of moving away from WordPress to a static page generator. Iâ€™ve learned from my mistake and Iâ€™m back to the hosted version of WordPress to only worry about writing. It is a much more pleasurable experience. When you see this post it will mean that the transition has been made!

Now Iâ€™m back ðŸ™‚
