After two s[hort projects in the challenge](http://ramonsuarez.com/challenge-projects/), it is time for another monthly undertaking. This time I will be preparing a coworking course that builds on and expands [The Coworking Handbook](https://www.coworkinghandbook.com). The book’s content is still 100% valid and applicable, but I can add extra knowledge from running Betacowork the years after I published the book (and from selling it!).

I’ve already spent some time looking into platforms like [Udemy,](https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=nqvRWNWHD4Q&offerid=507388.7&type=3&subid=0) [Teachable](https://teachable.com/) and [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/) among others. There’s also [LearnWorlds](https://www.learnworlds.com/), proposed by one of the readers of the book. I’ve not made up my mind about the best one to use but I know that it will not be Skillshare: they pay way too little and teachers deserve a good compensation!

Of course, being a promoter and member of coworking spaces I’ve reached out to [David](https://teachable.com/), who is an specialist in online education and also a member of [Betacowork](https://www.betacowork.com). I’m really looking forward to having a conversation with him.

The first think I will do is draft the core structure of the course. Then I will share it with the people that are already in the [mail list of The Coworking Handbook](https://www.coworkinghandbook.com/newsletter/) (signup if you want to get in too). There’s a couple thousand people that are interested and interesting.

I may create first a small email course to use as a teaser and lead magnet, but I need to work on the main course content first to make sure that I add enough value and that I don’t give it all away.

One thing is clear about the **content: it will have to focus on sales and on [community](https://www.coworkinghandbook.com/extract-of-the-community-chapter-on-the-next-web-how-to-value-and-nurture-your-local-coworking-community/),** which seem to be the weak points of way to many coworking businesses.

**What would you like to learn from my coworking course ?** I’m really looking forward to your input.

*PS: If you are interested in running a coworking space, check this helpful [coworking resources](https://www.coworkinghandbook.com/resources/).*
