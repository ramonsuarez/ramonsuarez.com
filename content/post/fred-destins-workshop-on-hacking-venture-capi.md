> ### LIFT10: Workshop on Hacking Venture Capital
> 
> This morning at the excellent LIFT Conference I gave a two hour workshop on “[Hacking Venture Capital](http://liftconference.com/fr/lift10/workshops/hacking-venture-capital)” designed to give entrepreneurs a hands-on experience of (a) pitching and (b) negotiating with detailed debrief and tricks of the trade. As promised I wanted to share the material and presentations, with my thanks to @venturehacks for a good part of the content.
