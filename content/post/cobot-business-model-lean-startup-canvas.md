> #### Problem
> 
> *What???s the problem we think we have identified?*
> 
> Running a coworking space involves too much repetitive work (which costs too much money to do by hand):
> 
> - managing members (sign up, sign contract, change plan or other details from time to time)
> - collecting payments, invoicing
> 
> In order to be profitable coworking spaces need to make more money by providing extra services/access to resources.
> 
> - The management/accounting part is hard, so it keeps spaces from doing it.
> 
> Coworking spaces don???t know how much money they could actually make because of missing metrics.
> 
> #### Solution
> 
> *What???s our proposed solution?*
> 
> Users can sign up and manage their memberships themselves using cobot, taking a lot of work from the space managers.
> 
> Spaces can automate collecting payments for rent and extra services, which again reduces their work load and makes offering some services feasible in the first place.
> 
> Our analytics section provides spaces with the numbers they need to optimize their business and make more/enough money.
> 
> #### Unique Value Proposition
> 
> *What value do we provide that no-one else does?*
> 
> By combining features from different areas like accounting, payments and member management into a single tool and tailoring them to coworking we can help a coworking space much better than other, more generic and not so well integrated tools can.
> 
> #### Unfair Advantage
> 
> *What makes cobot stand out against the competition, why can???t it be copied easily?*
> 
> It???s pretty complicated to build a system that fits all the different requirements the coworking spaces have. As a [software company](http://upstre.am) that also runs a [coworking space](http://co-up.de) we have a lot of knowledge about both – coworking and creating software.
> 
> #### Customer Segments
> 
> Coworking spaces around the world (at the time ~600 spaces worldwide)
> 
> Spaces can be segmented by size and location
> 
> Location:
> 
> - U.S. where coworking is already very popular and there are hundreds of spaces, language is English
> - Europe: ~ 200 spaces (Oct 2010), many speak English, but also requirements for localization
> - Rest of the world – probably a large market but many different languages, we don???t know anyone there yet
> 
> Size:
> 
> - Small spaces that just started, &lt; 20 members – don???t really need cobot that much, but it???s easier to use it from the start than to transition later
> - Medium spaces, 20 to 60 members, this is our main target group
> - Large, &gt; 60 members, might still use cobot, but maybe some of those need their own, more specific/customized tools
> 
> #### Channels
> 
> *How can we reach new customers?*
> 
> The global [coworking mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/coworking) allows us to see when and where new spaces open and we can get in contact with existing spaces as well.
> 
> Word of mouth: new spaces ask the established ones for advice, they will recommend us if we can build a great product.
> 
> Coworking conferences and other events, where we can give talks and demo cobot.
> 
> #### Key Activity
> 
> *What will our users do on cobot?*
> 
> Coworking managers will manage their members, charge people for services, collect payments.
> 
> Coworkers will use the site to book additional services, change their information/plan etc.
> 
> #### Revenue Streams
> 
> *Where does the money come from?*
> 
> We charge the coworking spaces money for using cobot, depending on their size (more coworkers = more income = higher fee)
> 
> We expect a coworking space who uses cobot as its business backend to keep using it pretty much for the lifetime of the space (&gt; 5 years). An average space with ~30 coworkers would pay us 3600 EUR in 5 years (2 EUR \* 30 coworkers \* 12 months \* 5 years)
> 
> If we can sign up 66 spaces within 1 year our monthly revenue would be 4000 EUR
> 
> If we can sign up 200 spaces in 2 years our monthly revenue would be 12000 EUR
> 
> #### Cost Structure
> 
> ##### After 1 year
> 
> People:
> 
> - Alex: 3500 EUR/month
> - contractors for sales: ?
> 
> Servers: ~200 EUR
> 
> ##### After 2 years
> 
> People:
> 
> - Thilo, Alex: 8000 EUR/month
> - - 1 support/PR/sales: 3000 EUR/month
> - = 11k EUR
> 
> cobot is not inherently viral so we need to do sales to get new customers (esp. in the beginning, until word of mouth generates enough customers)
> 
> - New customers are acquired by email/phone, demoing/explaining the product, giving support. If we convert 5.5 spaces per month and a sales person costs us 1.5k/month our acquisition cost would be 300 EUR
> 
> Hosting: the more spaces we add the more servers we have to add
> 
> - Right now we are running 170 coworkers on a small EC2 instance for ~60 EUR/month with some space to spare
> - 200 spaces with 30 coworkers would be 6000 coworkers = 20 instances; I think we could do with 15 instances = 900 EUR/month; with larger, more cost effective instances we can bring this down to 500 EUR/month
> 
> Overall cost = 11.5k EUR/month
> 
> #### Competition
> 
> [Nadine](http://wiki.coworking.info/w/page/31359618/NadineProject) and other open source projects:
> 
> - advantages: people can extend it the way they want, don???t have to pay for it (at least no service fee, they have to pay for setup, maintenance, development though)
> - disadvantages: no commercial support (for now), spaces have to set up hosting themselves, no clear product vision or product owner
> 
> Existing (membership) management apps:
> 
> - advantages: they may be better than cobot at specific tasks
> - disadvantages: not an integrated solution specifically for coworking, so will never be an ideal solution

via [cobot.tumblr.com](http://cobot.tumblr.com/post/1489264800/our-business-model)A great exercise by Alex: public distribution of the business model of his great tool to manage coworking spaces and a step further into lean startup. Can only say bravo!
