If you have a startup or want to start one, you can not miss it.

The event starts at 2pm and will go on until the night, with some drinks after a Betagroup Pitch Slam. My experience tells me that it will end up even later with informal dinners going on until late.

You do not have to attend the full event, just go to the parts that interest you or can attend. It is free and you just have to [sign up here](http://startupsbe-estw.eventbrite.com/ "signup tech event startups Brussels").

I’m one of the organizers representing the [Betagroup](http://www.betagroup.be/), as part of the 19 Belgian organizations supporting Tech Entrepreneurs that have decided to combine their efforts to accelerate our startup environment even more via [**Startups.be – Future Business Support**](http://startups.be "Startup support Belgium").
