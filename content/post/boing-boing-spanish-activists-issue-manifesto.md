[Spanish activists issue manifesto on the rights of Internet users](http://ow.ly/It4B)</div>Javier “Barrapunto” Candeira writes, “Last Monday the Spanish Government sent the parliament the latest draft for the Ley de Economia Sostenible (Sustainable Economy Act), which contained riders modifying the current laws on copyright and interactive services. These amendments give the Spanish Ministy of Culture the administrative power to take down websites (or order ISPs to block those hosted overseas), all without a court order and in the name of ‘safeguarding Intellectual Property Laws against Internet Piracy’. For this reason some of us have written a manifesto that is being published today all over Spanish weblogs and media.”
