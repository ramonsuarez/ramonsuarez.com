<div class="p_embed p_image_embed"></div><div>![](/uploads/2013/02/media_https2i1picplzt_gbxtz-scaled500.jpg)</div>via [picplz.com](http://picplz.com/user/ramonsuarez/pic/r3j5l/)</div>During the presentation of the latest Samsung products in Brussels, I fell in love with a couple geeky gadgets and the first one was the <a>Samsung pico projector SP-H03</a>. The fact of being able to play with a projector that fit the palm of my hand was just mesmerizing.

Luckily, I have been able to test it. I find it to be a **step in the right direction: pico projectors in our mobile phones and tablets**.

Looking at the pictures of their suggested uses I can just not imagine any sales person using it to do a presentation projected against a binder. First of all, the projection would not be much bigger than the screen of a tablet, and for that the efect would be much better with an iPad or one of Samsung’s tablets.

Second, because it is made with led light projectors it has a great autonomy, but **can not be used if there’s sun light** for larger projections than a computer screen. This is a problem common to all leds that I also have in my diving lamps: they just don’t work under sunlight. The good thing is that the moment you use them **at night or in a close space with artificial light (like in the picture) the projector is powerful enough to give crisp images of close to 2 meters wide**. Bigger than that it looses focus, but can still be an enjoyable experience for leisure projections (in my case watching Outsorced in bed projected about 4 meters wide in the wall.) **The loss of focus was annoying at first but the size of the screen made for a great watching experience.**

My feeling about it is that it is **a great geek toy, but not a gadget to use professionally**.

Do any of you use it for business?
