The more analytics I see, the more puzzled I am by the disparity among them. In this particular case, the **huge difference between [Posterous stats](http://posterous.com/ "Posterous, dead easy blogging") and [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com/ "Google Analytics free site statistics")** after just one month of publishing.

According to Posterous, this blog has already received **1722 visits**. But according to Google Analytics, it has received **294 with 499 page views**, of which **222** are **unique visitors**. I guess that what Posterous counts are pageviews, but still the difference is way too big among them.

**Who should I trust?**
