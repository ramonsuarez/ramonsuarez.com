**[Plugg](http://plugg.eu "Plugg, Web and Mobile entrepreneurs event in Brussels") is coming again to Brussels**, to celebrate “**entrepreneurship and innovatio**n in Europe and raising global awareness for those European **start-ups** in the **Web / Mobile 2.0** field that stand out in the crop”. After my participation last year, I can not wait for this year’s edition on March 11. The quality of the speakers and of the companies participating in the Startup Rally, plus the top-noch European networking make it a must-be for all those interested in Web and Mobile ventures.

I was glad to see that one of my favourite speakers from [last year’s Plugg](http://www.blogbruselas.com/2009/03/plugg-magnifico.html "Plugg 2009: ¡Magnífico!") was again invited for this edition: **[Inmaculada Martínez](http://inmamartinez.com/ "Inma Martinez, venture capitalist")**. It was surprising to see that the **most inspiring speech came from a venture capitalist**. Insightful and provocative, her presentation was labeled European entrepreneurship: the good, the bad And the ugly, which she turned into **European entrepreneurs: clueless, pirates and superbad!**

[European Entrepreneurship: The Good, The Bad And The Ugly](http://vimeo.com/3684935) from [Plugg Conference](http://vimeo.com/plugg) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

Basically, it boils down to: **Europeans are great pioneers, and awful marketeers**.

The other highlight of last year’s conference also came from a round table of VC, and I’m sure going to miss **[Fred Destin](http://2009.plugg.eu/program/speakers/p/detail/fred-destin)** and [**Matthäus Krzykowski**](http://2009.plugg.eu/program/speakers/p/detail/matthaumlus-krzykowski) in this year’s Plugg.
