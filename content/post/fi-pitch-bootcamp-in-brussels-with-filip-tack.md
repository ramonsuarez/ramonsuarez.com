This is my first event as director of the [Founder Insitute in Brussels](http://www.founderinstitute.com/apply/52). I’m really looking forward to it. Filip is amazing and I’m sure that the ideas that people will pitch are also gonna be fantastic (and a great way to prepare for [Startup Weekend Brussels](http://brussels.startupweekend.org)!)
