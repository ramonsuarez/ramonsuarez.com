Since the last time… 
---------------------

[Last week](https://ramonsuarez.com/new-project-business-idea-sprint/) I spent time going through my business ideation framework and came up with twenty some new ideas easily. I also came up with new questions accelerate the process. The time frame was too short to be able to really work on improving the framework a lot, but at least I improved the spreadsheet to organize the ideas.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](/uploads/2019/03/ideation-framework-tabs.png)</figure>I did advance a lot in my affiliate research and restarted my Google sheets course (and learned a lot!).

So mixed success in last week’s project and now a new challenge.

----------------

One of the things I’m working on to improve myself and my days is **journaling**. I’m currently working with productivity and personal journals, but also with my shooting journal, that I started a few months after I started shooting almost two years ago.

What sparked the need in me to start journaling my trainings and competitions was that I decided to take it more seriously and try to really progress.

**Journaling has been very helpful**. Keeping a log has helped me remember better and move forward faster. I’ve also done some tracking in other areas of my life, but journaling goes beyond tracking by **looking forward to how to improve**.

I’ve done a lot of research and reading, and worked with different formats already, which allows me to create something that can be helpful.

### Why do the journal

I know there’s interest because **15% of the Olympic Pistol signups come from** [**this downloadable pdf shooting diary**](https://www.olympicpistol.com/pistol-shooting-diary-journal/) (that I’m going to improve).

Selling this journal will be a **good test to see if I can bring some money in from this small niche** to pay for my training and competition expenses.

Beyond selling this journal to shooters, I’m interested in this project because it will help me re-learn about how to do page layout, make a cover, and add another product that I can market and experiment with.

Secondary projects
------------------

**Interleaving** is part of this journey to find new projects and to learn. Mixing projects improves long term learning and keeps my motivation up.

The next two weeks I want to progress with my newly acquired **affiliate and SEO knowledge to improve my coworking handbook site**. I will do some keyword and topic digging to capture more organic traffic and convert more site readers into book buyers.

I will **explore Gumroad as a course delivery platform** to publish again my coworking community course with what I hope are just a few small changes.

Another thing along the same lines is to **work on new exclusive content that I can bundle with** [**the PDF of the coworking handbook**](https://gumroad.com/l/coworkinghandbook) and to deliver more value to the mail list subscribers, improving the welcome automation emails.

Since I killed the first coworking.space project I’ve been thinking more and more on turning it into a **private community of practitioners**. Maybe something that can be included with the book and after a free trial turn it into a subscription?

I will also **rename my fail posts to flops**. Reframing helps look at things in a more positive way. *What word would you use?*

The **ideation framework** is also in the list of things to do. I want to generate more business ideas and questions to help with the development of the framework.

Timeline &amp; deliverables
---------------------------

**The journal should be for sale in** [**my Gumroad**](https://gumroad.com/ramonsuarez) **and** [**Amazon stores**](https://www.amazon.com/shop/ramonsuarez) **for Thursday April 5 at noon.**
