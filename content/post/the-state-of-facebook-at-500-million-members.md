Among their different initiatives to promote this success and to gain even more users, I’ve found this graphic by [Facebakers](http://www.facebakers.com) to be very interesting, giving us a snapshot of Facebook’s state.

The USA is clearly ahead of all other countries in number of users, with the UK coming in second place with a fifth of the users. Most of the users are over 24 years old and there’s a half and half gender split, with a missing 3% that I wonder if it is made of un-sexed angels.

As a Spaniard living in Belgium there’s two things that have surprised me on the anecdote side: **Spain is the 10th country with more Facebook users and Belgium is the 7th oldest country in the social Network**.
