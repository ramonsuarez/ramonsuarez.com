I hope this list will give you a easier perspective on the things I do beyond [my way too large CV](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramonsuarez/). 
### Internet websites and projects
* [Olympic Pistol](https://www.olympicpistol.com): a website for competitive pistol shooters where I share insights, coaching, reviews, and useful content. 
* [Coworking Handbook](https://www.coworkinghandbook.com/): my manual for how to launch and run sustainable coworking spaces, including useful resources for the coworking owners and managers community.
* [Entrepreneurship Challenge](https://www.ramonsuarez.com/post/challenge-projects/): launch at least one business related project a month. I stopped when I decided to pursue olympicpistol.com.  
* [Betacowork](https://www.betacowork.com/author/ramonsuarez/): what's left of my posts at my coworking space in Brussels, a milestone for coworking in Belgium. 
* [Blog Bruselas](/project/blogbruselas/): an archive of my first blog where I started experimenting and sharing my love for the city of Brussels. 

#### No longer linkable
* BigF Method: a framework to come up with new business ideas and to choose which ones to pursue. 
* Fight Hate Not Shooters: an initiative to improve the image of sport shooters and the perception of the sport through merchandising.
