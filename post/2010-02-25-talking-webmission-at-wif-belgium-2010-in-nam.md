<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via [youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKlNzLUusw4&feature=youtu.be)</div>I recently had the chance of being interviewed by the [AWT TV](http://www.youtube.com/user/awtbe) during the [belgian WIF 2010](http://wif-dogstudio.be/) web design event in Namur. Explaining may be an overstatement, it is more like mumbling, but hopefully some people will dig it and [join the next Webmission](http://wiki.webmission.be).

It was a great occasion to get out of Brussels and see some new web-heads. Always looking forward to it!
