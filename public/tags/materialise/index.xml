      <description>At the last TEDxLeuven I was gratefully surprised: I found out about Materialise, a world leader and pioneer in industrial 3D printing, which comes out of Belgium. One more of the leading tech companies that not so many people have ever heard about, but which is responsible for the printing of most personalized ear implants in the world.
Luckily for me they had a stand at MultiMania and I got a chance to talk with them and to hold and examine some of the printed objects they had with them.</description>
