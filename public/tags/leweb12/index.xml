      <title>PeerReach: find and understand social media influencers</title>

      <description>PeerReach is a tool to find the influencers in a topic, language and geographic area. But it does more than help you find them, it helps you understand their main areas of interest and influence in each one of them.
You probably thought of other tools that are stablished in the market- like Klout, PeerIndex and Kredly- that already do something similar. These competitors are focused on their ranking number and are not so good in defining the right areas of interest and influence.</description>

      <description>kwiqly wants to help you save energy money by using the data from your utility provider and combining it with the weather information. There’s nothing to install, no need to buy any hardware.
James Ferguson, has presented the company at the startup competition at LeWeb and they are one of my candidates for the final.

      <title>Be-Bound: surf the internet without WiFi or data connectivity</title>
      <link>https://test.ramonsuarez.com/be-bound-surf-the-internet-without-wifi-or-da/</link>

      <description>Be-Bound is the great world changer of the startup competition at LeWeb. They propose a smarphone app that relies on the standard mobile phone networks to allow for Internet use. How do they do it? By sending sms to and from their servers.
To use it you buy prepaid credit and every action (reading an email, forwarding a message, updating your Twitter timeline), costs from one to three credits.
This application can really be useful on areas with no data coverage and for people traveling to other countries that don’t want to pay the hefty roaming data fees.</description>

      <title>Smarter than Siri: Jini, a proactive personal assistant on your smartphone</title>

      <description>Jini is an application for smartphones that proactively sugests you things to do based on other applications usage (like RunKeeper) and the sensor information from your phone (location, speed, light…)
Filip Maertens is the founder of this Belgian startup that can really change our mobile world. A good example of what Jini does: when he arrived to Paris to present at the Startup competition at LeWeb, Jini sugested a route to go jogging close to his hotel.</description>

      <title>TUZZit: the CheckThis of online project management</title>
      <link>https://test.ramonsuarez.com/tuzzit-the-checkthis-of-online-project-manage/</link>

      <description>TUZZit is a very promising online project management tool that focuses in ease of use and visual appeal. There are no save buttons and it allows to present ideas and task just like we would do in a whiteboard, with a visual organization instead of a date or alphabet based presentation.
When Christophe Fruyter showed it to me at the Belgian Startups stand at LeWeb, I inmediately thought of CheckThis, the online tool to publish your internet posters.</description>

On this occassion there will be 15 startups participating from the three Belgian regions: 14 as part of the Startups.be #beleweb delegation and one in the startup competition (Jini). I will also be there as an official blogger, writing mostly for the Spanish internet business blog Loogic.
