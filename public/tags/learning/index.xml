      <description>One of the things that I want to improve through practice is structuring my work. Planning every week and day, keeping a productivity journal and using a task manager for all my projects has helped. I have advanced a lot in structuring and I’m now working to take it another step further with the implementation of a long term vision.
An important part of planning is prioritization, and for me this is intimately linked to your vision for the future.</description>

      <description>One of the things that has always amazed me about the Renaissance is how the most famous wise-men of the time had all multiple fields of expertise and interest. They had a focus on learning and education, coming out of a time of obscurity, fighting ignorance, status quo and superstition. Leonardo Da Vinci is a great example having his main source of living in art but also developing his knowledge and inventions in science.</description>
