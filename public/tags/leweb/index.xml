      <title>PeerReach: find and understand social media influencers</title>
      <link>https://www.ramonsuarez.com/peerreach-find-and-understand-social-media-in/</link>

      <description>PeerReach is a tool to find the influencers in a topic, language and geographic area. But it does more than help you find them, it helps you understand their main areas of interest and influence in each one of them.
You probably thought of other tools that are stablished in the market- like Klout, PeerIndex and Kredly- that already do something similar. These competitors are focused on their ranking number and are not so good in defining the right areas of interest and influence.</description>

      <description>kwiqly wants to help you save energy money by using the data from your utility provider and combining it with the weather information. There’s nothing to install, no need to buy any hardware.
James Ferguson, has presented the company at the startup competition at LeWeb and they are one of my candidates for the final.

      <title>Be-Bound: surf the internet without WiFi or data connectivity</title>
      <link>https://www.ramonsuarez.com/be-bound-surf-the-internet-without-wifi-or-da/</link>

      <guid>https://www.ramonsuarez.com/be-bound-surf-the-internet-without-wifi-or-da/</guid>
      <description>Be-Bound is the great world changer of the startup competition at LeWeb. They propose a smarphone app that relies on the standard mobile phone networks to allow for Internet use. How do they do it? By sending sms to and from their servers.
To use it you buy prepaid credit and every action (reading an email, forwarding a message, updating your Twitter timeline), costs from one to three credits.
This application can really be useful on areas with no data coverage and for people traveling to other countries that don’t want to pay the hefty roaming data fees.</description>

      <title>Smarter than Siri: Jini, a proactive personal assistant on your smartphone</title>
      <link>https://www.ramonsuarez.com/smarter-than-siri-jini-a-proactive-personal-a/</link>

      <guid>https://www.ramonsuarez.com/smarter-than-siri-jini-a-proactive-personal-a/</guid>
      <description>Jini is an application for smartphones that proactively sugests you things to do based on other applications usage (like RunKeeper) and the sensor information from your phone (location, speed, light…)
Filip Maertens is the founder of this Belgian startup that can really change our mobile world. A good example of what Jini does: when he arrived to Paris to present at the Startup competition at LeWeb, Jini sugested a route to go jogging close to his hotel.</description>

      <title>TUZZit: the CheckThis of online project management</title>
      <link>https://www.ramonsuarez.com/tuzzit-the-checkthis-of-online-project-manage/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2012 16:16:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.ramonsuarez.com/tuzzit-the-checkthis-of-online-project-manage/</guid>
      <description>TUZZit is a very promising online project management tool that focuses in ease of use and visual appeal. There are no save buttons and it allows to present ideas and task just like we would do in a whiteboard, with a visual organization instead of a date or alphabet based presentation.
When Christophe Fruyter showed it to me at the Belgian Startups stand at LeWeb, I inmediately thought of CheckThis, the online tool to publish your internet posters.</description>

      <description>They showed a good example at their stand for other brands to follow, by lending their cameras out for the people at LeWeb to try out. The cellphone manufactures and carriers should learn from Kodak and Madlen to help others help you by using your products.</description>

      <link>https://www.ramonsuarez.com/renault-to-rent-the-batteries-of-its-new-elec/</link>

      <guid>https://www.ramonsuarez.com/renault-to-rent-the-batteries-of-its-new-elec/</guid>
      <description>Renault is bringing an interesting business model to the market with its new electric cars: they will sell the cars and rent the batteries. Advantages for the users: no worries about lifetime of the batteries, recycling taken care of by the company. Advantage for the company: recurring revenue and stronger bond with clients.
Matthieu Tenenbaum, deputy electric car program director, presents the new electric cars (Twizy, Fluence and Dezire), and talks about the business model and partnerships with cities and corporations.</description>

      <description>If you know me, you know I hate driving. But I really want to drive a Twizy electric city car (no driving license needed.) I will be test driving a Fluence later on the day.
Disclosure: Renault pays for my travel and lodging in Paris for LeWeb, but I&amp;rsquo;m publishing what I want and when I want 🙂 </description>

      <description>For those that can not make it to LeWeb this year, an easy way to watch the plenary and the startup competition and to follow what is said about it in social media. You can also track the hashtags #leweb10 and #leweb. I will be watching all this live in Paris, twitting about it (follow @ramonsuarez) and hopefully also blogging right here at ramonsuarez.com. Enjoy!

      <description>These are the responses given by Loïc to the short questionnary I sent him. He was really quick tp answer!
What is LeWeb like for Loïc Le Meur? LeWeb is a tool box for the european entpreneur: from the inspiration to find ideas to start a business to networking with Google, Microsoft or Facebook and raising angel or VC money. They can do it all during two days. This year we even have a “how to get acquired” panel to help them understand how to sell their business if they like.</description>
