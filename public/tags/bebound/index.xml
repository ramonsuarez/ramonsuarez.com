      <description>Be-Bound is the great world changer of the startup competition at LeWeb. They propose a smarphone app that relies on the standard mobile phone networks to allow for Internet use. How do they do it? By sending sms to and from their servers.
To use it you buy prepaid credit and every action (reading an email, forwarding a message, updating your Twitter timeline), costs from one to three credits.
This application can really be useful on areas with no data coverage and for people traveling to other countries that donâ€™t want to pay the hefty roaming data fees.</description>
