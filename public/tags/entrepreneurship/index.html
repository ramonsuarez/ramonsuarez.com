And then Jean dropped the bomb Jean Derely got on an improvised stage to thank the sponsors and go through all the things that have happened in the last 4 years, and then proceeded to drop the bomb: Jean will no longer run the Betagroup.
I cannot say it was a surprise for me or the other members of the Betagroup team (we had been working on his decision for about a month), but it was still a sad moment for me.

      You never know who’s gonna be who or where you are going to end Don’t treat those that are not yet somebody with disrespect. Even when I worked in public affairs this was a must. You never know where people are going to be at next. You cannot know everything about everybody, specially of those that you just met or haven’t had the time to get acquainted yet. Today’s trainee, junior employee or young entrepreneur could be tomorrow’s big thing, not in the long time.

      Fred Ooms has just finished publishing the interview we had a couple months ago. It was really nice to have some time to talk entrepreneurship with somebody like Fred, alumnus of MBA Solvay like myself, and also working with a university to try to bring part of their research knowledge and patents to market. We just set up a video call and got the interview rolling. Nice, lean and true. In his blog you can find a great selection of entrepreneurship video interviews.

Allmost all participants are over 25 years old 77% of the graduated companies are progressing ahead of their plan This last point stresses what I like the most about the Founder Institute: it is about doing. There’s no better place to help you transform your idea into a company in just 4 months.

      In case you do not know about it, the Beta Group is the largest Internet &amp; Tech entrepreneurship networking event in Belgium, with about 350 attendees in each of its monthly meetups. The event consists of a pitch slam with six startups showcasing their products, short requests and announcements from the audience (the live tweets), and lots of networking over free warm beer. A must.
Disclosure: I am a member of the Beta Group’s council, and proud of it!
