      Beyond the great experience of spending a few days in a super-geeky event, I also had the opportunity to prepare with Jonan this study about the perception of the European Blogosphere based on the responses given by European bloggers invited to Campus Party Europe. This is not a scientific work, it is fully subjective but still bears a lot of interesting information that prompted a very interesting debate with my copresenter Ben Hammersley and with the audience.

      Of all the blogs I follow, only the professional ones keep up the pace. A lot of personal bloggers have stopped writing or greatly reduced their contributions. Why wouldn’t they with Facebook and Twitter’s instant gratification and reduced effort? Why on earth would we have to consider that it is a problem?
Lets face it, most of the personal blogposts are exactly that, personal, and directed to a group of friends: they will be much better served in a less publicly scrutinized platform like Facebook, or Netlog, or Tuenti, or you-name-the-closed-garden-social-network.

      The numbers have been included with all their zeros (taking into account USA numbering) to make it easier to grasp the volumes we are talking about and to try to avoid some of the mistakes that are usually made when transferring billions and trillions from country to country. It will also be easier to do copy and pasting to a spreadsheet program (which sucks in transnational settings.) I have outlined a couple disparities in numbers, which are probably due to rounding and differences in the dates of samples.

      I had my first experiences with Posterous’ customer support this week and it has been very positive. As you can see from my posts, I use this blog as a notebook for content I find on the Internet (my memory in the cloud) thanks to Posterous’ wonderful bookmarklet. A few days ago, I went back to one of these “memories” and found that the links were not working (and that although it had over 100 readers, nobody had said a thing about it, but that’s another story).

      On top of it, he is just great. A bloguer at heart, he lives by the principle of sharing knowledge and promotes access to himself with a full disclosure of his contact details.

      If you promote it they might come. You could be writing the most fantastic blog on earth but if no one knows about it why bother? It’s almost like the old saying, “If a tree falls in the woods and no one is there to hear it, did it make a sound?
Unfortunately, we get bombarded all the time with unnecessary, irrelevant and useless products. But it proves the point: because of the promotion they thrive (not necessarily survive a long time or be considered a success.
