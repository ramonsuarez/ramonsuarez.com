      <description>WOW! The Looks The design of the Samsung 9 series makes you scream wow. When you get it, even the box makes you say wow. It is beautiful, sleek and different, something you want to carry around because it will make others say the same and look at you in a much better way. And that is exactly what happens. Wherever I’ve pulled it out questions have arised about it and everybody wanted to hold it.</description>

      <description>Luckily, I have been able to test it. I find it to be a step in the right direction: pico projectors in our mobile phones and tablets.
Looking at the pictures of their suggested uses I can just not imagine any sales person using it to do a presentation projected against a binder. First of all, the projection would not be much bigger than the screen of a tablet, and for that the efect would be much better with an iPad or one of Samsung’s tablets.</description>
