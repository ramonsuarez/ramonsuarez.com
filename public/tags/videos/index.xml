      <title>Brands, learn about your audience&amp;#8217;s personality with Whit.li</title>

      <guid>https://www.ramonsuarez.com/brands-learn-about-your-audiences-personality-with-whit-li/</guid>
      <description>This year I had the chance to catch up with Andy Gillentine and Jack Holt, cofounders of Whit.li, to see what had happened since the Whit.li API was released. It allowed to check compatibility of two people based on the analysis of their social media profiles, and the target companies to use this service where collaborative consumption sites like AirBnB. The talks with the participants then and the follow up meetings taught them that the people who were really interested were brands, advertising and media companies.</description>

      <title>PeerReach: find and understand social media influencers</title>
      <link>https://www.ramonsuarez.com/peerreach-find-and-understand-social-media-in/</link>

      <guid>https://www.ramonsuarez.com/peerreach-find-and-understand-social-media-in/</guid>
      <description>PeerReach is a tool to find the influencers in a topic, language and geographic area. But it does more than help you find them, it helps you understand their main areas of interest and influence in each one of them.
You probably thought of other tools that are stablished in the market- like Klout, PeerIndex and Kredly- that already do something similar. These competitors are focused on their ranking number and are not so good in defining the right areas of interest and influence.</description>

      <guid>https://www.ramonsuarez.com/kwiqly-improve-the-energy-use-of-your-buildin/</guid>
      <description>kwiqly wants to help you save energy money by using the data from your utility provider and combining it with the weather information. There’s nothing to install, no need to buy any hardware.
James Ferguson, has presented the company at the startup competition at LeWeb and they are one of my candidates for the final.

      <title>Be-Bound: surf the internet without WiFi or data connectivity</title>
      <link>https://www.ramonsuarez.com/be-bound-surf-the-internet-without-wifi-or-da/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2012 09:45:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.ramonsuarez.com/be-bound-surf-the-internet-without-wifi-or-da/</guid>
      <description>Be-Bound is the great world changer of the startup competition at LeWeb. They propose a smarphone app that relies on the standard mobile phone networks to allow for Internet use. How do they do it? By sending sms to and from their servers.
To use it you buy prepaid credit and every action (reading an email, forwarding a message, updating your Twitter timeline), costs from one to three credits.
This application can really be useful on areas with no data coverage and for people traveling to other countries that don’t want to pay the hefty roaming data fees.</description>

      <title>Smarter than Siri: Jini, a proactive personal assistant on your smartphone</title>
      <link>https://www.ramonsuarez.com/smarter-than-siri-jini-a-proactive-personal-a/</link>

      <guid>https://www.ramonsuarez.com/smarter-than-siri-jini-a-proactive-personal-a/</guid>
      <description>Jini is an application for smartphones that proactively sugests you things to do based on other applications usage (like RunKeeper) and the sensor information from your phone (location, speed, light…)
Filip Maertens is the founder of this Belgian startup that can really change our mobile world. A good example of what Jini does: when he arrived to Paris to present at the Startup competition at LeWeb, Jini sugested a route to go jogging close to his hotel.</description>

      <title>TUZZit: the CheckThis of online project management</title>
      <link>https://www.ramonsuarez.com/tuzzit-the-checkthis-of-online-project-manage/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2012 16:16:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.ramonsuarez.com/tuzzit-the-checkthis-of-online-project-manage/</guid>
      <description>TUZZit is a very promising online project management tool that focuses in ease of use and visual appeal. There are no save buttons and it allows to present ideas and task just like we would do in a whiteboard, with a visual organization instead of a date or alphabet based presentation.
When Christophe Fruyter showed it to me at the Belgian Startups stand at LeWeb, I inmediately thought of CheckThis, the online tool to publish your internet posters.</description>

      <description>Fred Ooms has just finished publishing the interview we had a couple months ago. It was really nice to have some time to talk entrepreneurship with somebody like Fred, alumnus of MBA Solvay like myself, and also working with a university to try to bring part of their research knowledge and patents to market. We just set up a video call and got the interview rolling. Nice, lean and true. In his blog you can find a great selection of entrepreneurship video interviews.</description>

      <guid>https://www.ramonsuarez.com/choosing-the-right-channel-to-request-attenti/</guid>
      <description> The communication channnel choice is complex and does not depend on cost. The more attention it requires, the less people we interact with regularly. The two extremes of the table are Skype video conversations (3) and Facebook/Twitter broadcasting (100+) Cultural impact of availability on the choice of channel: the bussier the other person is, the less we will use a highly synchronous channel like phone or Skype. </description>

      <description>Renault is bringing an interesting business model to the market with its new electric cars: they will sell the cars and rent the batteries. Advantages for the users: no worries about lifetime of the batteries, recycling taken care of by the company. Advantage for the company: recurring revenue and stronger bond with clients.
Matthieu Tenenbaum, deputy electric car program director, presents the new electric cars (Twizy, Fluence and Dezire), and talks about the business model and partnerships with cities and corporations.</description>

      <description>For those that can not make it to LeWeb this year, an easy way to watch the plenary and the startup competition and to follow what is said about it in social media. You can also track the hashtags #leweb10 and #leweb. I will be watching all this live in Paris, twitting about it (follow @ramonsuarez) and hopefully also blogging right here at ramonsuarez.com. Enjoy!

      <title>Sync video presentations with slides (Omnisio alternatives)</title>

      <guid>https://www.ramonsuarez.com/sync-video-presentations-with-slides-omnisio/</guid>
      <description> There are several alternatives to omnisio:
Use an online tool like Vcasmo or Zentation. Convert the presentation to images and then insert it in the video with a non-linear video editor (I use KDEnlive, here you have a manual for **Microsoft Produce**r). This can be complicated, but it offers more control. Check this video tutorials to learn the basics. </description>

      <description>Beyond the great experience of spending a few days in a super-geeky event, I also had the opportunity to prepare with Jonan this study about the perception of the European Blogosphere based on the responses given by European bloggers invited to Campus Party Europe. This is not a scientific work, it is fully subjective but still bears a lot of interesting information that prompted a very interesting debate with my copresenter Ben Hammersley and with the audience.</description>

      <description>The numbers have been included with all their zeros (taking into account USA numbering) to make it easier to grasp the volumes we are talking about and to try to avoid some of the mistakes that are usually made when transferring billions and trillions from country to country. It will also be easier to do copy and pasting to a spreadsheet program (which sucks in transnational settings.) I have outlined a couple disparities in numbers, which are probably due to rounding and differences in the dates of samples.</description>

      <description>Fred Destin is a VC I follow since I saw his brilliant participation in this roundtable at Plugg in Brussels: VC Panel: Where’s The Money Gone? from Plugg Conference on Vimeo.
He was completely detached at the beginning, but thanks to the arts of Matthäus Krzykowski he ended up getting fully into it and providing for one of the best moments of the conference.</description>
