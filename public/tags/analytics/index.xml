      <description>The more analytics I see, the more puzzled I am by the disparity among them. In this particular case, the huge difference between Posterous stats and Google Analytics after just one month of publishing.
According to Posterous, this blog has already received 1722 visits. But according to Google Analytics, it has received 294 with 499 page views, of which 222 are unique visitors. I guess that what Posterous counts are pageviews, but still the difference is way too big among them.</description>
