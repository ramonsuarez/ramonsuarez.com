        Flop: Sales Acceleration

      The sales acceleration project has been a real flop.
BIGF Method My biggest effort was on the BIGF Method and it did not really pay much: one extra paying customer and only 26 free customers.
I reached out to my contacts, got a post about my ideation method published in Spain, run ads on Quora and Google…
There are a few factors to consider for this flop:
The original landing page that I contracted via Fiverr did not work at all.

      Come out with new project ideas for the challenge. Improve the framework itself and think about how to best deliver it. My first sprint ended with 145 ideas in the list and I’ve added 21 more since then. I keep them all in a spreadsheet that is very helpful to filter them out by my criteria: Make, Learn, Invest, Drop, and also to mark some as done and remove them from the list of ideas yet to be made.

      It took a while, but the coworking community course has finally been launched. I kept my timing and the email announcing it went out last Thursday.
Doing a text only course was a good choice. It is much easier to work and rework the content and I can make the delivery much faster. The students have to put their time into doing the tasks to improve their own coworking space community, not on trying to understand my accent in a video.

      Don’t miss any of my adventures as a Jedi entrepreneur
Since the public launch of coworking.space last week (and of my entrepreneurship challenge) I’ve been ramping up the promotion of the service to try to get more spaces in via Facebook groups and pages, reddit, email and some advertising. My post to the coworking Google group is held for moderation.
Sign-ups So far 18 spaces have signed up… but only one has drafted the listing following the guidelines and with help from me: Betacowork Coworking Brussels.
