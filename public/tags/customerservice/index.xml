      <description>I’ve been unlucky enough to start buying at LDLC-Pro my IT material. They had a good reputation and based on it I went ahead and bought a computer, plus an extra SSD disc for another computer, plus some other stuff.

As you can see from my posts, I use this blog as a notebook for content I find on the Internet (my memory in the cloud) thanks to Posterous’ wonderful bookmarklet. A few days ago, I went back to one of these “memories” and found that the links were not working (and that although it had over 100 readers, nobody had said a thing about it, but that’s another story).</description>
