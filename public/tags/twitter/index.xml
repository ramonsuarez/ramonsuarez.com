      <description>This year I had the chance to catch up with Andy Gillentine and Jack Holt, cofounders of Whit.li, to see what had happened since the Whit.li API was released. It allowed to check compatibility of two people based on the analysis of their social media profiles, and the target companies to use this service where collaborative consumption sites like AirBnB. The talks with the participants then and the follow up meetings taught them that the people who were really interested were brands, advertising and media companies.</description>

      <description>For those that can not make it to LeWeb this year, an easy way to watch the plenary and the startup competition and to follow what is said about it in social media. You can also track the hashtags #leweb10 and #leweb. I will be watching all this live in Paris, twitting about it (follow @ramonsuarez) and hopefully also blogging right here at ramonsuarez.com. Enjoy!

      <description>The average Twitter account in Belgium follows 90 Twitter users, is followed by 87, is listed 4,5 times, and has tweeted 378 times.
Out of an estimate of 75.000 to 100.000 accounts, 32% Tweet weekly and 18% have no activity at all.
I’m looking forward to more information coming from Bruno about what is going on in this country. Thank you Bruno!</description>

      <title>Yes, blogging has peaked and it is not a problem</title>

      <description>Of all the blogs I follow, only the professional ones keep up the pace. A lot of personal bloggers have stopped writing or greatly reduced their contributions. Why wouldn’t they with Facebook and Twitter’s instant gratification and reduced effort? Why on earth would we have to consider that it is a problem?
Lets face it, most of the personal blogposts are exactly that, personal, and directed to a group of friends: they will be much better served in a less publicly scrutinized platform like Facebook, or Netlog, or Tuenti, or you-name-the-closed-garden-social-network.</description>

      <title>Video: The state of the Internet in numbers</title>
      <link>https://www.ramonsuarez.com/video-the-state-of-the-internet-in-numbers/</link>

      <description>The numbers have been included with all their zeros (taking into account USA numbering) to make it easier to grasp the volumes we are talking about and to try to avoid some of the mistakes that are usually made when transferring billions and trillions from country to country. It will also be easier to do copy and pasting to a spreadsheet program (which sucks in transnational settings.) I have outlined a couple disparities in numbers, which are probably due to rounding and differences in the dates of samples.</description>

      <description>Tomorrow I’will be participating in DevCom Brussels, a forum for commercial development in Belgium. Besides networking and getting inspired by the conferences, I will be speaking about social media and also doing 7 minute one to one demos. One of them will be an introduction to Twitter, covering the basic reasons, advantages and things to keep in mind when using it (although these can be applied to all social networks). This are the notes I’ve prepared:</description>
