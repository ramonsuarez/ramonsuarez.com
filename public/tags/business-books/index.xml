      <description>One of the things that I want to improve through practice is structuring my work. Planning every week and day, keeping a productivity journal and using a task manager for all my projects has helped.

My friend Charlie Crouch just asked me which are my book must haves for an Internet business course he is organizing in Australia. This is my list:
Information Rules. Shapiro, Varian (yes, Google’s Varian). A classic that is fully applicable now a days. The examples are old but not the business logic. Influence. Robert Chialdini. To understand the psychology of sales and use it to your advantage.</description>
