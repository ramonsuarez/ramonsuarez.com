      <description>Luckily, I have been able to test it. I find it to be a step in the right direction: pico projectors in our mobile phones and tablets.
Looking at the pictures of their suggested uses I can just not imagine any sales person using it to do a presentation projected against a binder. First of all, the projection would not be much bigger than the screen of a tablet, and for that the efect would be much better with an iPad or one of Samsungâ€™s tablets.</description>
