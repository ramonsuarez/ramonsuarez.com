One of the most unexpected and motivating emails came from my father in law, Graziano.

      He included this four charts with stats about the Founder Institute’s participants that are quite interesting.
Allmost all participants are over 25 years old 77% of the graduated companies are progressing ahead of their plan This last point stresses what I like the most about the Founder Institute: it is about doing. There’s no better place to help you transform your idea into a company in just 4 months.

      The USA is clearly ahead of all other countries in number of users, with the UK coming in second place with a fifth of the users. Most of the users are over 24 years old and there’s a half and half gender split, with a missing 3% that I wonder if it is made of un-sexed angels.
As a Spaniard living in Belgium there’s two things that have surprised me on the anecdote side: Spain is the 10th country with more Facebook users and Belgium is the 7th oldest country in the social Network.

      Skype, when it was still part of eBay, issued quarterly updates but those have now stopped. Nevertheless, here are the latest numbers:
Skype added 39 million registered users in the fourth quarter to end the year with a total of 560 million. The number of Skype-to-Skype call minutes totaled 36.1 billion in the final three months of 2009. Skype users made more the 250 billion minutes worth of Skype-to-Skype calls from the time the service was launched through the end of 2009.

      Of all the blogs I follow, only the professional ones keep up the pace. A lot of personal bloggers have stopped writing or greatly reduced their contributions. Why wouldn’t they with Facebook and Twitter’s instant gratification and reduced effort? Why on earth would we have to consider that it is a problem?
Lets face it, most of the personal blogposts are exactly that, personal, and directed to a group of friends: they will be much better served in a less publicly scrutinized platform like Facebook, or Netlog, or Tuenti, or you-name-the-closed-garden-social-network.

      The numbers have been included with all their zeros (taking into account USA numbering) to make it easier to grasp the volumes we are talking about and to try to avoid some of the mistakes that are usually made when transferring billions and trillions from country to country. It will also be easier to do copy and pasting to a spreadsheet program (which sucks in transnational settings.) I have outlined a couple disparities in numbers, which are probably due to rounding and differences in the dates of samples.

      The average social network user is 37 years old. The dominant age group is 35-44. 79% of users are older than 25 years old. The 18-24 years old group does not top any site I’m sure the European aged distribution of social network users would not be far from this.
Hopefully this will definitely kill the still-heard-off-belief that social networking is for teenagers.

      The more analytics I see, the more puzzled I am by the disparity among them. In this particular case, the huge difference between Posterous stats and Google Analytics after just one month of publishing.
According to Posterous, this blog has already received 1722 visits. But according to Google Analytics, it has received 294 with 499 page views, of which 222 are unique visitors. I guess that what Posterous counts are pageviews, but still the difference is way too big among them.

The research confirmed a trend that we’ve seen in recent years: that more seniors are becoming active on the web. In November of 2004, there were 11.3 million active seniors online. In November 2009, that number jumped by 55% to 17.5 million. In addition, they spend more time on the web, totaling an average of 58 hours a month in front of the browser.
