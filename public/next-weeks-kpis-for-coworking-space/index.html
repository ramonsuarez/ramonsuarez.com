As my good friend and entrepreneur <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/xaviercorman/">Xavier Corman</a> has pointed out, I have to have clear KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and I think that those KPIs should be public. So here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 coworking space pages published following the <a href="https://www.coworking.space/how-to/">guidelines</a>.</li>
<li>And then 30 by Friday.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I don’t see enough traction I will keep the site running but stop promoting it. It will be in the backburner until I decide on something else to do with it (I already have a few ideas but would love to hear from you).</p>
