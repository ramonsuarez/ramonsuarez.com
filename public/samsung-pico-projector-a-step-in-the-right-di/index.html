<p>Luckily, I have been able to test it. I find it to be a <strong>step in the right direction: pico projectors in our mobile phones and tablets</strong>.</p>
<p>Looking at the pictures of their suggested uses I can just not imagine any sales person using it to do a presentation projected against a binder. First of all, the projection would not be much bigger than the screen of a tablet, and for that the efect would be much better with an iPad or one of Samsung’s tablets.</p>
<p>Second, because it is made with led light projectors it has a great autonomy, but <strong>can not be used if there’s sun light</strong> for larger projections than a computer screen. This is a problem common to all leds that I also have in my diving lamps: they just don’t work under sunlight. The good thing is that the moment you use them <strong>at night or in a close space with artificial light (like in the picture) the projector is powerful enough to give crisp images of close to 2 meters wide</strong>. Bigger than that it looses focus, but can still be an enjoyable experience for leisure projections (in my case watching Outsorced in bed projected about 4 meters wide in the wall.) <strong>The loss of focus was annoying at first but the size of the screen made for a great watching experience.</strong></p>
<p>My feeling about it is that it is <strong>a great geek toy, but not a gadget to use professionally</strong>.</p>
<p>Do any of you use it for business?</p>
