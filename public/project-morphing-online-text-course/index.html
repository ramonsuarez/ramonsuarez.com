So I’m going to continue working on the <a href="https://www.coworkinghandbook.com/coworking-community-course-draft/">Coworking Community Course</a> with a text only course.</p>
<p>The core of the course is ready, I have about 130 slides with a mix of information and exercises. It is a workbook focused on getting coworking space operators to take actions that will help them build a vibrant and healthy communities while they are taking the course and that will give provide a toolbox they can keep on using and referring to. It will be delivered in daily bits, like a challenge, not to overload the participants and to nudge them into taking repeated action.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>Write down <strong>timeline, deliverables and milestones</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Find the tool or platform to deliver it</strong>. Ideally WordPress or an external service that I can set as a sub domain of <a href="https://www.coworkinghandbook.com">The Coworking Handbook.</a></li>
<li><strong>Adapt copy to written email delivery</strong>. The slides where thought of as my script for the video courses. I need to extend the bullet points.</li>
<li><strong>ecide on a final name</strong>. I like the idea of a challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Make a landing page with at least one image that I create</strong> to support the course.</li>
<li><strong>Create a lead magnet and a short email sequence to convert to students</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Find a way to or create forms to submit workbook to dos</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Find a way to automatically generate a final document with all the workbooks submissions from the students</strong>. This is a nice have, so I will probably do it manually first.</li>
<li><strong>Get to work!</strong> I’ve been too slow lately. No failure sobbing!</li>
</ul>

<p>The deadline for this project is <strong>February 21st</strong>.</p>
