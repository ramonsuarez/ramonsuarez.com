I reached out to my contacts, got a post about my ideation method published in Spain, run ads on Quora and Google…
There are a few factors to consider for this flop:
The original landing page that I contracted via Fiverr did not work at all.

      TL;DR: Because it does not matter.
After 227 days (almost seven and a half months) of daily meditation I missed one day, which broke the challenge I had set up for myself of meditating everyday for a year. The people at Headspace kindly reset the counter so that the streak would not be broken when I asked them how many days I had meditated in a row, but this did not change the fact that I had missed a day.

I’ve scoured the Internet for some templates to use and my scorecard is based on the spreadsheet created by Carrie Dils.

      After all the ins and outs of this course, only 4 people signed up. This is far from the target of 10 that I committed to in mastermind/accountability group.

In fact this puts on hold the other coworking courses I had in mind (marketing and sales).

      It took a while, but the coworking community course has finally been launched. I kept my timing and the email announcing it went out last Thursday.
Doing a text only course was a good choice. It is much easier to work and rework the content and I can make the delivery much faster. The students have to put their time into doing the tasks to improve their own coworking space community, not on trying to understand my accent in a video.

      Not a habit yet Although I’ve managed to do so many days of continuous meditation practice it is not yet a habit (and I really wish it was). The 21 days rule is not working for me at all.
Not being able to do it every day at the same time because of the ever changing schedule of parenting makes it really hard to stick and adds a bit of angst, of fear of missing a day.

I have a lot of experience writing, but not writing for video. Long gone are my days at Canal + in Spain where I was asked to do some writing.

To learn the ropes and get my hand dirtied I’ve chosen to go first with the coworking community course. It is much shorter than the sales course so it will be easier to finish and launch it.

I started meditating in 2015 with a book and it was okayish, but when I started using the HeadSpace app I really felt the difference. After doing the fist 10 sessions I noticed that something had already changed in me.

My coworking book is something I’m proud of, that is helping a lot of people, and that is still bringing some revenue every month.

      It took a while, but the coworking community course has finally been launched. I kept my timing and the email announcing it went out last Thursday.
Doing a text only course was a good choice. It is much easier to work and rework the content and I can make the delivery much faster. The students have to put their time into doing the tasks to improve their own coworking space community, not on trying to understand my accent in a video.

      I’m not good with video yet, but there are many other delivery methods to share valuable content and help many people. So I’m going to continue working on the Coworking Community Course with a text only course.
The core of the course is ready, I have about 130 slides with a mix of information and exercises. It is a workbook focused on getting coworking space operators to take actions that will help them build a vibrant and healthy communities while they are taking the course and that will give provide a toolbox they can keep on using and referring to.

I have a lot of experience writing, but not writing for video. Long gone are my days at Canal + in Spain where I was asked to do some writing.

      Coworking Courses This week I launched a poll to the members of The Coworking Handbook Newsletter asking them for their priorities for a coworking course: sales or community. The answer was a clear both, so I’ve started both of them.
To learn the ropes and get my hand dirtied I’ve chosen to go first with the coworking community course. It is much shorter than the sales course so it will be easier to finish and launch it.

The first one that did, completely ignored the guidelines and did not even include a link to their site even after telling them about it. The only coworking space that followed the guidelines was Betacowork, my former coworking space (where I still work 1 to 3 days a week), and with a lot of help from me.

Choosing the Right Tool and Cleaning Up Contacts I dropped Mautic for being too complicated and awful to clean up contacts (the main problem I have with all the CRM I’ve tried so far). At the end I went for a much easier set up with the help of a Google add-on by Amit Argawal.

Doing a text only course was a good choice. It is much easier to work and rework the content and I can make the delivery much faster. The students have to put their time into doing the tasks to improve their own coworking space community, not on trying to understand my accent in a video.

      I’m not good with video yet, but there are many other delivery methods to share valuable content and help many people. So I’m going to continue working on the Coworking Community Course with a text only course.
The core of the course is ready, I have about 130 slides with a mix of information and exercises. It is a workbook focused on getting coworking space operators to take actions that will help them build a vibrant and healthy communities while they are taking the course and that will give provide a toolbox they can keep on using and referring to.

Creator’s block Self confidence Creator’s Block Making and online course is a creator challenge. Even if I’m using the content of my coworking book as the base, I’m adding a lot of content and I’m drafting it for video delivery.
I have a lot of experience writing, but not writing for video. Long gone are my days at Canal + in Spain where I was asked to do some writing.

      Coworking Courses This week I launched a poll to the members of The Coworking Handbook Newsletter asking them for their priorities for a coworking course: sales or community. The answer was a clear both, so I’ve started both of them.
To learn the ropes and get my hand dirtied I’ve chosen to go first with the coworking community course. It is much shorter than the sales course so it will be easier to finish and launch it.

I’ve already spent some time looking into platforms like Udemy, Teachable and Skillshare among others.

One of the main reasons for the entrepreneurship challenge is to get my hands dirty and it is working wonders.
Revamping Network and Mailing Lists So far 1479 emails of the segmentation project have gone out. The few responses I’m getting are extremely positive and I’ve had my first meeting thanks to it today.

      After the launch of my email campaign to refresh my network, I ‘ve decided to continue building on my skills and focus on three of the things I want to improve:
Repurposing content. Outsourcing some of my work. Automate as much as possible. Repurposing I have produced a lot of content, be it in the form of blog posts, books, conferences, social media shares… A lot of it is evergreen content (content that is good forever, that does not go bad after a certain date).

      Meditation has had a profound positive impact in my life. Being more aware is bringing a lot of improvements to my actions and feelings. It has improved my work, my personal relationships and my sport practice. I enjoy the benefits of awareness/mindfulness meditation.
I started meditating in 2015 with a book and it was okayish, but when I started using the HeadSpace app I really felt the difference. After doing the fist 10 sessions I noticed that something had already changed in me.

      After all the ins and outs of this course, only 4 people signed up. This is far from the target of 10 that I committed to in mastermind/accountability group. So I cancelled it, reimbursed everybody and closed my account in the e-learning platform (I don’t know if I will release it again nor when). In fact this puts on hold the other coworking courses I had in mind (marketing and sales).

      It took a while, but the coworking community course has finally been launched. I kept my timing and the email announcing it went out last Thursday.
Doing a text only course was a good choice. It is much easier to work and rework the content and I can make the delivery much faster. The students have to put their time into doing the tasks to improve their own coworking space community, not on trying to understand my accent in a video.

      I’m not good with video yet, but there are many other delivery methods to share valuable content and help many people. So I’m going to continue working on the Coworking Community Course with a text only course.
The core of the course is ready, I have about 130 slides with a mix of information and exercises. It is a workbook focused on getting coworking space operators to take actions that will help them build a vibrant and healthy communities while they are taking the course and that will give provide a toolbox they can keep on using and referring to.

I have a lot of experience writing, but not writing for video. Long gone are my days at Canal + in Spain where I was asked to do some writing.

      Coworking Courses This week I launched a poll to the members of The Coworking Handbook Newsletter asking them for their priorities for a coworking course: sales or community. The answer was a clear both, so I’ve started both of them.
To learn the ropes and get my hand dirtied I’ve chosen to go first with the coworking community course. It is much shorter than the sales course so it will be easier to finish and launch it.

The first one that did, completely ignored the guidelines and did not even include a link to their site even after telling them about it. The only coworking space that followed the guidelines was Betacowork, my former coworking space (where I still work 1 to 3 days a week), and with a lot of help from me.

10 coworking space pages published following the guidelines. And then 30 by Friday. If I don’t see enough traction I will keep the site running but stop promoting it.

      This year I had the chance to catch up with Andy Gillentine and Jack Holt, cofounders of Whit.li, to see what had happened since the Whit.li API was released. It allowed to check compatibility of two people based on the analysis of their social media profiles, and the target companies to use this service where collaborative consumption sites like AirBnB. The talks with the participants then and the follow up meetings taught them that the people who were really interested were brands, advertising and media companies.

      One of the things that we discussed is how should to ensure that public funding on early stage startups does not bias the market, incentivising “good” ideas that nobody really cares about and ignoring others that are more needed.
My proposal, shared by other participants, is to follow market signals, so that it is the market that chooses and the public sector only reenforces those choices.
But the question is, which market signals?

      PeerReach is a tool to find the influencers in a topic, language and geographic area. But it does more than help you find them, it helps you understand their main areas of interest and influence in each one of them.
You probably thought of other tools that are stablished in the market- like Klout, PeerIndex and Kredly- that already do something similar. These competitors are focused on their ranking number and are not so good in defining the right areas of interest and influence.

      Be-Bound is the great world changer of the startup competition at LeWeb. They propose a smarphone app that relies on the standard mobile phone networks to allow for Internet use. How do they do it? By sending sms to and from their servers.
To use it you buy prepaid credit and every action (reading an email, forwarding a message, updating your Twitter timeline), costs from one to three credits.
This application can really be useful on areas with no data coverage and for people traveling to other countries that don’t want to pay the hefty roaming data fees.

      Fred Ooms has just finished publishing the interview we had a couple months ago. It was really nice to have some time to talk entrepreneurship with somebody like Fred, alumnus of MBA Solvay like myself, and also working with a university to try to bring part of their research knowledge and patents to market. We just set up a video call and got the interview rolling. Nice, lean and true. In his blog you can find a great selection of entrepreneurship video interviews.

Here’s a simplified How-To:
Download Ubuntu, make sure that in the dropdown box you choose the 64bit version.

      Luckily, I have been able to test it. I find it to be a step in the right direction: pico projectors in our mobile phones and tablets.
Looking at the pictures of their suggested uses I can just not imagine any sales person using it to do a presentation projected against a binder. First of all, the projection would not be much bigger than the screen of a tablet, and for that the efect would be much better with an iPad or one of Samsung’s tablets.

      Paying peanuts per post is way too common right now, if the posts are not just free. The worst of it is the lack of sustainability of this model that leads to an ever decreasing number of journalists and bloggers, standardization of news, lack of research, reduction of sources and amateurization of the whole writing business.

      Renault is bringing an interesting business model to the market with its new electric cars: they will sell the cars and rent the batteries. Advantages for the users: no worries about lifetime of the batteries, recycling taken care of by the company. Advantage for the company: recurring revenue and stronger bond with clients.
Matthieu Tenenbaum, deputy electric car program director, presents the new electric cars (Twizy, Fluence and Dezire), and talks about the business model and partnerships with cities and corporations.

What is LeWeb like for Loïc Le Meur? LeWeb is a tool box for the european entpreneur: from the inspiration to find ideas to start a business to networking with Google, Microsoft or Facebook and raising angel or VC money. They can do it all during two days. This year we even have a “how to get acquired” panel to help them understand how to sell their business if they like.

Use an online tool like Vcasmo or Zentation.

This can be complicated, but it offers more control. Check this video tutorials to learn the basics.

The conversation was mostly in English, but as you can see it has been published in Dutch.

      One of the things that has always amazed me about the Renaissance is how the most famous wise-men of the time had all multiple fields of expertise and interest. They had a focus on learning and education, coming out of a time of obscurity, fighting ignorance, status quo and superstition. Leonardo Da Vinci is a great example having his main source of living in art but also developing his knowledge and inventions in science.

      Dear Android handset manufacturers:??
I understand that you would like to lock-in your users with something more than the hardware you produce, which risks being completely commoditized soon. But please, do yourself and your users a favor and stop screwing up the interface of Android. The user experience with Android needs a lot of refinement still and you are only subtracting from it.??
If you really want to keep a healthy business and prevail over other systems like Apple’s iPhone, what you should do is create an umbrella organization together with Google to help each other produce the best Android interface on earth that will work with all the different devices you make.

      Here’s the list of my favorite places to eat and drink in Madrid, my much loved hometown. They are all either in the center of the city or within a short bus ride. There are a hell of a lot more good places and you will see that the city is very lively around socializing in bars and restaurants, and above all night life.
If you have time and can read Spanish, I recommend taking a look at the Madrid Tapas’ Guide by Pisto y Nopisto (a refined eating and drinking blog) and this very complete tapas guide.

      Of all the blogs I follow, only the professional ones keep up the pace. A lot of personal bloggers have stopped writing or greatly reduced their contributions. Why wouldn’t they with Facebook and Twitter’s instant gratification and reduced effort? Why on earth would we have to consider that it is a problem?
Lets face it, most of the personal blogposts are exactly that, personal, and directed to a group of friends: they will be much better served in a less publicly scrutinized platform like Facebook, or Netlog, or Tuenti, or you-name-the-closed-garden-social-network.

      The numbers have been included with all their zeros (taking into account USA numbering) to make it easier to grasp the volumes we are talking about and to try to avoid some of the mistakes that are usually made when transferring billions and trillions from country to country. It will also be easier to do copy and pasting to a spreadsheet program (which sucks in transnational settings.) I have outlined a couple disparities in numbers, which are probably due to rounding and differences in the dates of samples.

      The average social network user is 37 years old. The dominant age group is 35-44. 79% of users are older than 25 years old. The 18-24 years old group does not top any site I’m sure the European aged distribution of social network users would not be far from this.
Hopefully this will definitely kill the still-heard-off-belief that social networking is for teenagers.

After my participation last year, I can not wait for this year’s edition on March 11. The quality of the speakers and of the companies participating in the Startup Rally, plus the top-noch European networking make it a must-be for all those interested in Web and Mobile ventures.

      Some marketing and communication professionals wrongly despise SEO, considering it just a bunch of technical tricks used to divert Internet users towards sites not worthy of their attention. The truth is that they should look at it from the perspective of their clients: good SEO helps users find the content they are looking for. SEO is not some arkane cult or ritual. Most marketing and communication professionals know some of its basics thanks to their education in journalism, and most of the rest are very easy to imply using a little reasoning and common sense or even better: reading.

      Although I agree that the quality of the product is very important, I do not agree with the idea that the product itself is the marketing. This falls into the traditional engineer trap where the creators of a product just concentrate their efforts in the product and disregard marketing.
Without marketing your great product will die in obscurity. There are many forms of marketing and different actions to take depending on your willingness and resources.

The research confirmed a trend that we’ve seen in recent years: that more seniors are becoming active on the web. In November of 2004, there were 11.3 million active seniors online. In November 2009, that number jumped by 55% to 17.5 million. In addition, they spend more time on the web, totaling an average of 58 hours a month in front of the browser.

      On top of it, he is just great. A bloguer at heart, he lives by the principle of sharing knowledge and promotes access to himself with a full disclosure of his contact details.

      If you promote it they might come. You could be writing the most fantastic blog on earth but if no one knows about it why bother? It’s almost like the old saying, “If a tree falls in the woods and no one is there to hear it, did it make a sound?
Unfortunately, we get bombarded all the time with unnecessary, irrelevant and useless products. But it proves the point: because of the promotion they thrive (not necessarily survive a long time or be considered a success.

      Coworking Courses This week I launched a poll to the members of The Coworking Handbook Newsletter asking them for their priorities for a coworking course: sales or community. The answer was a clear both, so I’ve started both of them.
To learn the ropes and get my hand dirtied I’ve chosen to go first with the coworking community course. It is much shorter than the sales course so it will be easier to finish and launch it.

As Ash Maurya says:
Practice Trumps Theory
One of the main reasons for the entrepreneurship challenge is to get my hands dirty and it is working wonders.
Revamping Network and Mailing Lists So far 1479 emails of the segmentation project have gone out. The few responses I’m getting are extremely positive and I’ve had my first meeting thanks to it today.

      After the launch of my email campaign to refresh my network, I ‘ve decided to continue building on my skills and focus on three of the things I want to improve:
Repurposing content. Outsourcing some of my work. Automate as much as possible. Repurposing I have produced a lot of content, be it in the form of blog posts, books, conferences, social media shares… A lot of it is evergreen content (content that is good forever, that does not go bad after a certain date).

Choosing the Right Tool and Cleaning Up Contacts I dropped Mautic for being too complicated and awful to clean up contacts (the main problem I have with all the CRM I’ve tried so far). At the end I went for a much easier set up with the help of a Google add-on by Amit Argawal.

      As part of my entrepreneurship challenge, I’m now dipping my toes into email marketing automation to take advantage of all the contacts I’ve collected through the years and try to deliver value to them based on their interests.
So far I’ve imported over 25.000 contacts to Mautic and a few of the imports are still on hold. There will have to be a major cleaning afterwards. I feel a bit like the star of Going Postal, overwhelmed by the amount of mail to deliver.
