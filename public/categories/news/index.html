        Ins and Outs of the  Coworking Course Launch

      It took a while, but the coworking community course has finally been launched. I kept my timing and the email announcing it went out last Thursday.
Doing a text only course was a good choice. It is much easier to work and rework the content and I can make the delivery much faster. The students have to put their time into doing the tasks to improve their own coworking space community, not on trying to understand my accent in a video.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Deadlines need to be precise My first mistake when I launched the video course project was not to set a precise deadline. One month from now is not good enough, I need to have a date and time and keep it visible. I can then also prepare a timeline of the project and evaluate my progress towards it in chunks not just for the completion of the whole course.

      After two short projects in the challenge, it is time for another monthly undertaking. This time I will be preparing a coworking course that builds on and expands The Coworking Handbook. The book’s content is still 100% valid and applicable, but I can add extra knowledge from running Betacowork the years after I published the book (and from selling it!).
I’ve already spent some time looking into platforms like Udemy, Teachable and Skillshare among others.

      The launch of coworking.space has been a flop. The first KPI is far from being fulfilled. 18 spaces signed up but almost none of them edited their landing page. The first one that did, completely ignored the guidelines and did not even include a link to their site even after telling them about it. The only coworking space that followed the guidelines was Betacowork, my former coworking space (where I still work 1 to 3 days a week), and with a lot of help from me.

      I’ve taken this out of the original challenge post because it was confusing. I’ll keep it here for reference. Most of the learning can be found in the posts curated in the entrepreneurship challenge projects page.
These are some of the things I want to learn to do and to improve (in no particular order):
Automation in general and Email automation in particular; Blog monetization and affiliate revenue; Making online courses; Podcasting; Outsourcing and hiring; Marketing automation; ETF / Index tracker investing; Advanced spreadsheet magic; WordPress knowledge and autonomy; Sponsoring; Practice communities; Habit forming; Daily meditation; Give more structure to my work; … Do you want to hear from me?

      As part of the challenge to launch at least one project/business a month, I’m going to share here what goes well and what doesn’t. As my good friend and entrepreneur Xavier Corman has pointed out, I have to have clear KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and I think that those KPIs should be public. So here they are:
10 coworking space pages published following the guidelines. And then 30 by Friday. If I don’t see enough traction I will keep the site running but stop promoting it.

      After the sale of my coworking space I took a few months of vacation to charge up and care for my family. I needed to spend time with myself and to get ready for my next entrepreneurial challenge. There’s no doubt in my mind that my next step is as an entrepreneur: I want to create a business, buy one, or join one as a partner, not get a job.

      This blog has been abandoned for some time because I thought that some other blogs I had were more relevant for what I wanted to write. But it has been nagging me all the time.
This is the best outlet for my personal thinking, and for a while it was also a kind of web scrapbook (I miss you Posterous). This blog is more about Ramon and his many interests, about ideas, thoughts and doubts.
