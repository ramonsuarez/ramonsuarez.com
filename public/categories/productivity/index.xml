      <description>I’ve had to remove all pictures publicly available in other sites, even the promotional picture of the author used in his Amazon profile.
I’ve had to update the capitalization of words to match their style guides, although I do not work for them.
I’ve had to add copyright and trademark symbols all over the place although they are not even mandatory to use and, the TM are not registered (they are just claiming them) and many of them will never be able to be registered because they are just common words being used in a common sense.</description>
