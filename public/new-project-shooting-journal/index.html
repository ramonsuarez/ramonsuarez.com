            <h2 id="since-the-last-time">Since the last time…</h2>
<p><a href="https://ramonsuarez.com/new-project-business-idea-sprint/">Last week</a> I spent time going through my business ideation framework and came up with twenty some new ideas easily. I also came up with new questions accelerate the process. The time frame was too short to be able to really work on improving the framework a lot, but at least I improved the spreadsheet to organize the ideas.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So mixed success in last week’s project and now a new challenge.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the things I’m working on to improve myself and my days is <strong>journaling</strong>. I’m currently working with productivity and personal journals, but also with my shooting journal, that I started a few months after I started shooting almost two years ago.</p>
<p>What sparked the need in me to start journaling my trainings and competitions was that I decided to take it more seriously and try to really progress.</p>
<p><strong>Journaling has been very helpful</strong>. Keeping a log has helped me remember better and move forward faster. I’ve also done some tracking in other areas of my life, but journaling goes beyond tracking by <strong>looking forward to how to improve</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ve done a lot of research and reading, and worked with different formats already, which allows me to create something that can be helpful.</p>
<h3 id="why-do-the-journal">Why do the journal</h3>
<p>I know there’s interest because <strong>15% of the Olympic Pistol signups come from</strong> <a href="https://www.olympicpistol.com/pistol-shooting-diary-journal/"><strong>this downloadable pdf shooting diary</strong></a> (that I’m going to improve).</p>
<p>Selling this journal will be a <strong>good test to see if I can bring some money in from this small niche</strong> to pay for my training and competition expenses.</p>
<p>Beyond selling this journal to shooters, I’m interested in this project because it will help me re-learn about how to do page layout, make a cover, and add another product that I can market and experiment with.</p>
<h2 id="secondary-projects">Secondary projects</h2>
<p><strong>Interleaving</strong> is part of this journey to find new projects and to learn. Mixing projects improves long term learning and keeps my motivation up.</p>
<p>The next two weeks I want to progress with my newly acquired <strong>affiliate and SEO knowledge to improve my coworking handbook site</strong>. I will do some keyword and topic digging to capture more organic traffic and convert more site readers into book buyers.</p>
<p>I will <strong>explore Gumroad as a course delivery platform</strong> to publish again my coworking community course with what I hope are just a few small changes.</p>
<p>Another thing along the same lines is to <strong>work on new exclusive content that I can bundle with</strong> <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/coworkinghandbook"><strong>the PDF of the coworking handbook</strong></a> and to deliver more value to the mail list subscribers, improving the welcome automation emails.</p>
<p>Since I killed the first coworking.space project I’ve been thinking more and more on turning it into a <strong>private community of practitioners</strong>. Maybe something that can be included with the book and after a free trial turn it into a subscription?</p>
<p>I will also <strong>rename my fail posts to flops</strong>. Reframing helps look at things in a more positive way. <em>What word would you use?</em></p>
<p>The <strong>ideation framework</strong> is also in the list of things to do. I want to generate more business ideas and questions to help with the development of the framework.</p>
<h2 id="timeline-amp-deliverables">Timeline &amp; deliverables</h2>
<p><strong>The journal should be for sale in</strong> <a href="https://gumroad.com/ramonsuarez"><strong>my Gumroad</strong></a> <strong>and</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/ramonsuarez"><strong>Amazon stores</strong></a> <strong>for Thursday April 5 at noon.</strong></p>
