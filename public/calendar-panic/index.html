<p>A few minutes ago I went into full on calendar panic. I was creating a webinar event, with its form, blog post and social media messages. I thought everything was alright, checked my calendar a couple times to make sure there was no mistake and published everything. And then I freaked out.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Fear got a hold on me and I did not see nor think about the dates. All I could think of is yet another calendar screw up. So I deleted everything and published <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ramonsuarezdotcom/videos/216479465970648/?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARD-tGxf_os04p-sO00RfTZC-Ev60DVqbC_o7_b-VFjsDYw2Fl0eRTszns9pdE7TNMwyA2g2WgNWwzD9rIW-3X8rigYlRWkX5el-t-5PlnwbmHDgHARK0-m-vYfbJVpz2YZlamqEYjfOzEb6xGnywkF6IF1HA8tnX3JpAvwHxpi22Ajmz2JQR5o4PDadMoj-UStRHsd5YWiZZBT9nbB-rv-TqZN9DMQW9ekUzcNQFrYYBDe-9x3-aJ3sAL1u8NBSYX_kmcBV3qOx1JITgrSzpwjqjrzsTJeclMrxcnmryE7GI-AjjEYh9EpeVIaw6smjKkJEgZiV8yuAwSxw5P_OoSzmRSIT5_NJ&amp;__tn__=-R">messages</a> all around owning my mistake.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The best thing I can do now is relax, be kind to myself and see how I can get over this fear. Tips are welcome.</p>
