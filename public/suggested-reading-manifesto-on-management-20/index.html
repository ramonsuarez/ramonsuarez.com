<p><strong>Without marketing your great product will die in obscurity</strong>. There are many forms of marketing and different actions to take depending on your <strong>willingness and resources</strong>. If you do not plan to do any marketing for your product you might as well spend your development money in <strong>lottery: you have the same chances of success</strong>.</p>
