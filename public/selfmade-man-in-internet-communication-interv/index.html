<p>I was lucky enough to be considered one of those internet brains, but I think that what tilted the balance was how I enjoy the good restaurants of Brussels. Nothing beats a nice conversation over lunch like the one we had! The place of choice was <a href="http://houtsiplou.be/">Houtsiplou</a>, home of a good selection of quality burgers.</p>
<p>The conversation was mostly in English, but as you can see it has been published in Dutch. I am really looking forward to start my intensive extreme-dutch course on Sunday to be able to read it, until then thereâ€™s always automatic translation: <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A//www.20kk.be/ramon&amp;hl=en&amp;langpair=auto%7Cen&amp;tbb=1&amp;ie=UTF-8">Selfmade man in internet communication</a>.</p>
