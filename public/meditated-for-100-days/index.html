<h2 id="not-a-habit-yet">Not a habit yet</h2>
<p>Although Iâ€™ve managed to do so many days of continuous meditation practice it is not yet a habit (and I really wish it was). The <a href="https://jamesclear.com/new-habit">21 days</a> rule is not working for me at all.</p>
<p>Not being able to do it every day at the same time because of the ever changing schedule of parenting makes it really hard to stick and adds a bit of angst, of fear of missing a day.</p>
<p>It has happened already at least three nights that Iâ€™ve gone to bed to sleep and I luckily realized I had not done my meditation that day. I find that these fear of missing a day is unhelpful, but I still want to get to 365 days of uninterrupted practice.</p>
<h2 id="challenge--monkey-mind">Challenge = Monkey Mind</h2>

<p>On the upside, Iâ€™m much better at getting back into the present moment and at being kinder to myself ðŸ™‚</p>
<h2 id="what-im-getting-out-of-it">What Iâ€™m getting out of it</h2>
<p>So far keeping my daily meditation has been great. It has boosted my confidence in myself and it is helping me be more open and deal better with many situations. Iâ€™m far from perfect but Iâ€™m getting better at many things and Iâ€™m in the way to more improvement.</p>
<p>Seeing the number of days going up every day gives me a nice small success to build on but it is not a personal goal in itself. This feels a bit wrong though: the number should not really matter, it is a shiny object. What matters is the positive impact that meditation has in my life.</p>
