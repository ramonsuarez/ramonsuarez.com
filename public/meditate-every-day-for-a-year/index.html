<p><strong>Meditation has had a profound positive impact in my life</strong>. Being more aware is bringing a lot of improvements to my actions and feelings. <strong>It has improved my work, my personal relationships and my sport practice</strong>. I enjoy the <a href="https://www.headspace.com/science/meditation-benefits">benefits</a> of awareness/mindfulness meditation.</p>
<p>I started meditating in 2015 with a book and it was okayish, but when I started using the HeadSpace app I really felt the difference. After doing the fist 10 sessions I noticed that something had already changed in me.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Since then I’ve been meditating on and off, tried other apps (none of them really worked for me), never really making a full week. I thought of it as yet another thing to do, an extra task and burden on my day, even though I know it has a lot of benefits for me. I even completely stopped for a while when I was burned out.</p>
<p>For the last few months I’ve been meditating more often, regularly but not daily. Now <strong>I’ve decided to meditate every day</strong>. I hope this will become like brushing my teeth, something I do every day automatically, without even thinking, and that I can’t leave the house without doing it.</p>
<p><img src="https://ramonsuarez.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/headspace_quote-108460_26-10-2018-1024x1024.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To help me succeed (and start the day with a success that motivates me and sets a positive mood) I’ve set 7 am as my meditation time. My son’s alarm is set for 7h15, and this way I have just enough time to do a 10 minute meditation. If I cannot get to do it then (babies and little kids do not follow very regular schedules), I do it as soon as I can. It can be a walking meditation, a commuting standing meditation, or the first thing I do when I arrive to the coworking space I work at (directly at my desk, I don’t mind the people in the room). My objective is not doing a number of minutes per day, but to do it every day. Some days I’ll do multiple meditation sessions, other days I’ll do a very short one. <strong>Meditation has to work for me, not me for meditation</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ve been also using a password for my computers to ingrain it in my brain, reminding me that I meditate every day. Changing my password every few weeks is a nice hack to help me get some stuff done and to do some psychological preparation for <a href="https://www.olympicpistol.com">my sport</a>.</p>
<p>The app reminders are helpful when I cannot meditate in the morning not to forget, but they don’t really entice me to meditate.</p>
<p>So far I’ve managed to meditate for 44 days in a row. My objective is to make it to a full year, but in the meantime I set myself shorter term objectives, like getting to 50, 75, 90…</p>

<p>What I’m struggling with is remembering to do the mindful moments during the day. I’m just too focused on whatever I’m doing and forget about it.</p>

<p>Try them all and see which one suits you best. I prefer Andy’s voice 🙂</p>
