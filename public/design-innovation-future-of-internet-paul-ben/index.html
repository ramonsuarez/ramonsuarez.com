<h2 id="paul-bennet-design-innovation">Paul Bennet “Design Innovation”</h2>
<p>IDEO’s journey current stage is Framing: design redefines the challenges facing organizations.</p>
<p>Design is about change, impact and optimism.</p>
<p>Now dealing with bigger issues: design of everyday life, social interactions &amp; behaviors, countries and societies.</p>
<p>Design with, not for.</p>
<p>Quick test to see if in good path (function) then design.</p>
<p>It is not about Can Do it is about Should Do. Does it make sense?</p>
<p>Not fan of big ideas (complicated) , fan of small ideas.</p>
<p>Obsessed with learning</p>
<h2 id="ben-hammersley-redefyning-everything">Ben Hammersley, “Redefyning everything”</h2>
<p>Geeks won:we are popular now.</p>
<p>We can see this just by measuring the amount of screens around us: ???glowin rectangles everywhere???.</p>
<p>Screens that don’t interact are broken. Anything that is flat is a screen. People want to interact with everything.</p>
<p>Anything is remixable, reusable.</p>
<p>Geeks Kill Industries: travel, music, movie distribution, newspapers…</p>
<p>New geeks will kill the old geeks</p>
<p>New revolution is not in hardware is about doing cool stuff on the Internet.</p>
<p>Data becomes all important.</p>
<p>Borders are increasingly weird: it doesn’t really matter where we are</p>
<p>x-shifting is the norm</p>
<p>Anything that’s not based on this last three elements is dead-</p>
<p>Internet is not going to go away.</p>
