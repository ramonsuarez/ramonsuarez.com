<ul>
<li>Repurposing content.</li>
<li>Outsourcing some of my work.</li>
<li>Automate as much as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="repurposing">Repurposing</h2>
<p>I have produced a lot of content, be it in the form of blog posts, books, conferences, social media sharesâ€¦ A lot of it is evergreen content (content that is good forever, that does not go bad after a certain date). I want to repurpose some of this content to produce other formats like infographics and presentations.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Iâ€™ve done this. If you follow some of my social media accounts (<em><a href="https://twitter.com/ramonsuarez">T</a></em><a href="https://twitter.com/ramonsuarez">witter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ramonsuarezdotcom">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramonsuarez/">Linkedin</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/ramonsuarez/">Pinterest</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/ramonsuarezv">YouTube</a>â€¦) you have seen articles reposted with different text in the post and quotes from my <a href="https://www.coworkinghandbook.com/?utm_source=ramonsuarez.com&amp;utm_medium=post">coworking book</a>.</p>
<p>Some of this content will be given away in exchange of an email to help build my mail lists.</p>
<h2 id="outsourcing">Outsourcing</h2>
<p>A lot of this content can be made more visual to appeal to different audiences, be shared more and bring in new traffic. Iâ€™m a words person, not an images person, so Iâ€™m going to outsource as much as I can.</p>
<p>The first platform Iâ€™m going to test is <a href="http://www.fiverr.com/s2/6024be1e4a">Fiverr</a>, and the first job is going to be to make an infographic out of my post about the <a href="https://www.coworkinghandbook.com/advantages-benefits-coworking-list/">advantages of coworking.</a></p>
<h2 id="automation">Automation</h2>
<p>There are too many tasks where I donâ€™t add any value and that can be automated:</p>
<ol>
<li>Posting the repurposed and recurring content.</li>
<li>Adding people to mailing lists.</li>
<li>Sending specific content based on the form submitted.</li>
<li>Launching drip campaigns to provide and get value</li>
<li>Browser macros to delete contacts from CRMsâ€¦</li>
</ol>
<p>Luckily I already have some experience with the first three, but I want to improve it by using new tools instead of hacking away with Google Forms and automate.io.</p>
<p>Can you help with any of these? Got questions? Use the comment section below this post ðŸ™‚</p>
