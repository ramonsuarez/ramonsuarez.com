<p><a href="https://www.coworkinghandbook.com">My coworking book</a> is something I’m proud of, that is helping a lot of people, and that is <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/moving-beyond-self-doubt-to-write-a-handbook-grossing-over-50k-eae5f6ebab">still bringing some revenue every month</a>. In fact it has brought way more than I ever thought it would. I feel obliged to promote it and improve the website to capture more traffic and to convert better, to keep up the sales. I see it as a great opportunity to apply all that I’m learning about SEO, automation and online sales.</p>
<p>At the same time, I can’t help but feel pressured by the people that (with great intentions) keep on telling me to do coworking stuff and monetize my reputation and knowledge. After all it took me a while to establish my authority in the field and to create the content that drives organic traffic to the Coworking Handbook site. Heck, I’m one of them!</p>
<p>It is like if was stuck into it forever, and I hate feeling stuck.</p>
<p>Part of me understands my coworking value and some of the potential, but another part of me wants to move on and flip the page.</p>
<p>I cannot help to think if, in this case, I’m a solution in search of a problem.</p>
<p>And it sucks.</p>
