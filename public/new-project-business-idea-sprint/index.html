<p>My first sprint ended with 145 ideas in the list and I’ve added 21 more since then. I keep them all in a spreadsheet that is very helpful to filter them out by my criteria: Make, Learn, Invest, Drop, and also to mark some as done and remove them from the list of ideas yet to be made.</p>
<p>Revisiting this list is also a good way to get my mind primed for developing new ideas and sometimes even upgrading one to the supreme Make category.</p>
<h2 id="milestones">Milestones</h2>
<p>So, I give myself <strong>until Friday to produce and filter down to maximum 10 ideas to make</strong>. Then on Monday I will announce the one I’ll be doing as the <a href="https://ramonsuarez.com/challenge-projects/">next challenge project</a>.</p>
<p>The next meeting of my mastermind group will be in a couple weeks. It will be helpful to set goals for that project.</p>
<h2 id="other-projects">Other projects</h2>
<p>There will not be many hours dedicated to this every day, that’s part of the method. To improve my creativity I have to give my diffuse thinking a chance, and that means jumping through different tasks, books, people, and time to walk and think about many things.</p>
<p>One of the things I really want to progress with is the use of spreadsheets, finishing this <a href="https://courses.benlcollins.com/p/advanced30">amazing Google Spreadsheets course </a>by Ben L. Collins.</p>
<p>Another thing I want to learn about is <strong>affiliate marketing to sell my own products and other people’s products</strong>, so I will be doing some researching and account opening.</p>
<p>Last Friday I started selling the <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/coworkinghandbook">coworking handbook PDF</a> and also the <strong>pre-sales of the <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/manualcoworking">Manual del coworking</a></strong> (the Spanish version of the book). I will have to do some promotion for these. To do this I have to improve my knowledge of online advertising. I will start with <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=nqvRWNWHD4Q&amp;offerid=507388.403314&amp;type=2&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Ffacebook-ads-facebook-marketing-mastery-guide%2F">this Facebook ads course</a>.</p>
