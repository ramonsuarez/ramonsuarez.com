To help me out I’m working on <a href="https://ramonsuarez.com/scorecard/">this scorecard</a> that tracks the <a href="https://ramonsuarez.com/my-vision-and-plan/">main goals and tactics</a> of each <a href="https://ramonsuarez.com/12-week-year-summary-and-review/">12 Week Year</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve scoured the Internet for some templates to use and my scorecard is based on the <a href="https://carriedils.com/book-review-the-12-week-year/">spreadsheet created by Carrie Dils</a>.</p>
<p>This is what the current <a href="https://ramonsuarez.com/scorecard/">scorecard looks like</a>:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I’ve now included <a href="https://ramonsuarez.com/scorecards/">my scorecard in this page</a>.</p>
<p>This is not where I track all my tasks, this is where I keep track of the three main goals for the quarter and of the tactics to reach them. I use a task manager, a productivity journal, and my email to track tasks.</p>
<p>Another thing I’m doing is adding some data to my calendar (e.g. <a href="https://ramonsuarez.com/12-week-year-summary-and-review/">strategic blocks</a>).</p>
<p>I would appreciate your help to make it easier to enter the data and not make mistakes. This is something that I want to release in the future to make it easy for others to implement their plans. If you use Airtable, do you think it can be imported there and use a form enter the data?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>
