<p>One of the main reasons for the <a href="http://ramonsuarez.com/launching-at-least-one-project-every-month-my-entrepreneurship-learning-challenge/">entrepreneurship challenge</a> is to get my hands dirty and it is working wonders.</p>
<h2 id="revamping-network-and-mailing-lists">Revamping Network and Mailing Lists</h2>
<p>So far <a href="http://ramonsuarez.com/the-email-segmentation-campaign-is-rolling/">1479 emails</a> of the <a href="http://ramonsuarez.com/dipping-my-toes-into-email-marketing-automation/">segmentation project</a> have gone out. The few responses Iâ€™m getting are extremely positive and Iâ€™ve had my first meeting thanks to it today. I know more about what some people are doing and is super interesting. Computer assisted networking FTW!</p>
<p><img src="https://ramonsuarez.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/giphy-1.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Only 10 people have signed up via the <a href="http://ramonsuarez.com/do-you-want-to-hear-from-me/">interest form </a>to hear back from me, but this blog is getting some more views (nothing crazy though)</p>
<p>On the down side, there are a lot of bad emails (maybe I validated the list too long ago, or the service was not that good), but so far no problems with deliverability. Iâ€™ve not dared to let go 1500 emails per day yet, but will probably do next week.</p>
<h2 id="repurposing-lead-magnets">Repurposing: Lead Magnets</h2>
<p>Iâ€™ve made a list of 44 pieces of content to use as lead magnets and get more relevant emails. You can check the <a href="https://ramonsuarez.com/category/projects/progress-report/">list here</a>. Hurry before I put it behind a form and you have to give me your email ðŸ™‚</p>
<p><img src="https://ramonsuarez.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/teaser-lead-magnets-challenge-1024x369.png" alt=""></p>
<p>They are separated by property and can be ordered by priority. Some of the <a href="https://www.olympicpistol.com">Olympic Pistol</a> documents are set to low priority because they already exist, ugly but available. I will probably improve them with outsourced help.</p>
<h2 id="outsourcing-via-fiverr">Outsourcing via Fiverr</h2>
<p>Iâ€™ve ordered two times the same infographic about the <a href="https://www.coworkinghandbook.com/advantages-benefits-coworking-list/">Advantages of Coworking</a> on <a href="http://www.fiverr.com/s2/6024be1e4a">Fiverr</a>. This is part of the first one Iâ€™ve received (still under revision), for which I paid $32.50: <img src="https://ramonsuarez.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/teaser-advantages-coworking-handbook-1024x394.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Iâ€™ve also ordered close to a hundred <a href="https://pin.it/kcxsdnuxjohdmi">Pinterest</a> quotes from my <a href="https://www.coworkinghandbook.com/">coworking book</a>. Iâ€™m curious about using Instagram to drive traffic to my posts and if including Instagram optimized images in my posts will result in more social shares.</p>
<p>Total expense so far is $62.50 including all of Fiverrâ€™s commissions.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve taken advantage of this first test to bookmark a bunch of profiles for the next orders.</p>
<h2 id="automation">Automation</h2>
<p>Iâ€™ve not managed to find the tool to manage all lead magnets and subscriptions in one place. Right now Iâ€™m working with a mix of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/">Google Sheets</a>, <a href="https://automate.io"> automate.io</a>and <a href="http://eepurl.com/dM3QvU">Mailchimp</a>.</p>
<p>This week I have created a few new bots with <a href="https://automate.io">automate.io</a> to send the new signups from people that want to hear from me to the relevant <a href="http://eepurl.com/dM3QvU">Mailchimp</a> list, but I have not turned them on yet. Iâ€™m missing running a test with <a href="https://www.benlcollins.com/spreadsheets/google-sheets-query-sql/">Google Sheets queries</a>.</p>
<p>The lead magnets I started adding to my <a href="https://www.olympicpistol.com">olympic pistol blog</a> four weeks ago have brought in 256 signups in a site that has only gotten 519 unique visitors in the last 30 days. This is great.</p>
<p>Gotta go train now. Make sure you tune in on Monday to learn about the <a href="http://ramonsuarez.com/challenge-projects/">next challenge</a>. Enjoy the weekend!</p>
