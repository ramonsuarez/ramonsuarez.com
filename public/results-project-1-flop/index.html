<p>The launch of <a href="https://www.coworking.space">coworking.space</a> has been a flop. The first <a href="https://ramonsuarez.com/next-weeks-kpis-for-coworking-space/">KPI</a> is far from being fulfilled. 18 spaces signed up but almost none of them edited their landing page. The first one that did, completely ignored the <a href="https://www.coworking.space/how-to/">guidelines</a> and did not even include a link to their site even after telling them about it. The only coworking space that followed the guidelines was <a href="https://betacowork.coworking.space">Betacowork</a>, my former coworking space (where I still work 1 to 3 days a week), and with a lot of help from me.</p>
<p>None of the help offers nor the requests for feedback where responded to.</p>
<p>This is a strong signal that there’s no interest in this iteration of coworking.space. The directory of landing pages is not relevant.</p>
<p>I still think there’s a lot to do to solve the <strong>main problem of coworking spaces: sales.</strong></p>
<p>As my friend Ash says, <strong><a href="https://blog.leanstack.com">love the problem not your solution</a></strong>.</p>

<p>I’m stopping work in this iteration of coworking.space but will keep on trying to find solutions that can be helpful to bring more business to coworking spaces around the world.</p>
