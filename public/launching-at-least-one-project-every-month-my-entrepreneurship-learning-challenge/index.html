I needed to spend time with myself and to get ready for my next entrepreneurial challenge. There’s no doubt in my mind that my next step is as an entrepreneur: I want to create a business, buy one, or join one as a partner, not get a job.</p>
<p>From all the experience I’ve gained through the years one of the best things I got is increased confidence, plus a much better educated gut instinct. I know I don’t know and it does not bother me: it drives me to learn!</p>
<h2 id="learning">Learning</h2>
<p><img src="https://ramonsuarez.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mini-ramon.png" alt=""></p>
<p>From the moment I was born I’ve been learning and changing. Not only kids learn and change (yes, that’s a pic of mini-me to give you an idea of how much I’ve changed at least physically), adults keep on learning and changing their whole life.</p>
<p>Challenges and learning do a lot more than keep me alive, they make me thrive. Looking for new businesses has added more wood to the fire and is pushing me to learn more. Whatever business I end up doing, what drives me are the learning and the challenge, so I’ve learned to roll with it.</p>
<h3 id="thinking">Thinking</h3>
<p><img src="https://ramonsuarez.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/thinking.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In the past few months I’ve done a lot of thinking trying to come up with business ideas and also on how to come up with those ideas. I’ve gotten a list of over 160 ideas so far thanks to the <a href="https://www.bifgmethod.com">business idea generation framework</a> I’ve come up with (more on that later) and have much clearer priorities and knowledge of myself. But the inaction was killing me.</p>
<h3 id="taking-action">Taking Action</h3>
<p>After a couple lunches with entrepreneurs friends I figured that I could not wait any more to find the perfect project. I have to take action on some projects to be able to learn what I need to learn. Getting things done and working drive my motivation up and allow me to confront situations that may end up becoming a good business opportunity along the way. I need to learn a lot more about many things to do what I want to do, and the only way to get the knowledge I need is through practice.</p>
<h2 id="business-idea-generation">Business Idea Generation</h2>
<p>When I started looking for business ideas I was a bit lost. There’s tons of info on how to validate ideas and work with them to product-market fit heavens, but all I found about generating ideas was for corporation working with their teams. I did read a lot of it, but could not find anything that was fit for entrepreneurs working by themselves. So I decided to <a href="https://www.bigfmethod.com">apply some common sense and brain grease to come up with my own</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to this effort I generated a list of 145 ideas in my first sprint, and I keep on adding ideas regularly. I’ve reduced the list to 10 businesses opportunities or projects with a very delicate methodology.</p>
<p><img src="https://ramonsuarez.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/axe.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>The definitive business idea is not there yet, or at least I cannot see it clearly, but I cannot sit around only thinking. My brain slows down if I don’t get more done! I have good lists of ideas to launch businesses, to invest, and to learn. I also want to have multiple projects running at the same time, to gain more freedom from them and also more financial freedom/independence.</p>
<p>After a couple lunches with entrepreneur friends I noticed exactly that: I’m thinking too slow and complicating things too much. So I went and launched a first project with a domain that I love: <a href="https://www.coworking.space">coworking.space</a> (more about it below). I also run an artificial intelligence experiment with the help of my brother.</p>
<p>This is not enough, but it has lead me to the next thing (or things, actually).</p>

<h2 id="my-entrepreneurship-challenge-launch-at-least-one-project-a-month">My Entrepreneurship Challenge: Launch at Least One Project a Month</h2>
<p>I’ve decided on setting up a learning and practicing challenge before I go on and do another idea sprint.</p>
<p>This is an exercise in entrepreneurship learning that will bring many rewards. From talking to friends and all the stuff I read and listen to, I’ve decided to launch at least one project a month. Some of then may be a bit longer, others may be shorter and some are ongoing (like revamping this blog).</p>
<p>I’m looking for a main business and side hustles to coexist. I’ll keep on launching projects at this pace until I fill my days. Those that do not thrive will be set aside to free time for more projects.</p>
<p>My progress will be shared through this blog, namely in via the <a href="https://ramonsuarez.com/category/projects/progress-report/">Progress Report category</a>. You can <a href="https://ramonsuarez.com/challenge-projects/">track the projects here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="monthly-projects">Monthly Projects</h3>
<p>So far I’ve got the following projects in the list:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.coworking.space">coworking.space</a></strong> : free directory listings and websites for coworking spaces. The aim is to drive coworkers to them. I’ve launched it publicly today. You can <a href="https://www.coworking.space/register-admin/">sign up and add your coworking space here</a>. I set up the site and early adopters are adding their spaces. One more week to promote it and then I will move on to the next project. I’m sure there are many more things to do here. Looking forward to hear from you.</li>
<li><strong>Email segmenting</strong>: One of the under-utilized assets that I have is email addresses. With all the events and initiatives I’ve organized I have a few thousand email addresses. I will send an email to each of them in batches to catch up and move them to different email lists based on their interests. Setting this up and getting it running should take less than a week, although the emails will be rolling out for months. <a href="https://ramonsuarez.com/do-you-want-to-hear-from-me/">Add your interests here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Business Idea Generation Framework</strong>: I already have the structure and the framework. Write the content, promote it, get feed back, tweak it. This will be my first dip into email dripping. I have to improve the name. <a href="https://ramonsuarez.com/do-you-want-to-hear-from-me/">Get the info</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Coworking Course</strong>: A lot of coworking space operators need help. My book <a href="https://www.coworkinghandbook.com/">The Coworking Handbook</a> has already done a lot of good. I’m sure I can help a lot more with a course and that I will get more meaningful interactions. Plus, I’ll learn how to make an online course. If you want in, <a href="https://ramonsuarez.com/do-you-want-to-hear-from-me/">signup here</a> for a special launch deal.</li>
<li><strong>10m Air Pistol Shooting Course</strong>: Shooting a piece of paper for hours is my hobby. I’ve been doing it for a year and a half and it has helped me a lot with many aspect of life. It is like long awareness meditation (be present!). On top of it, it is the first time that I’m any good at a sport. Finding a coach and people to teach me has been hell. I can help a lot of people around the world shoot better with what I already know and this will also help the sport. <a href="https://ramonsuarez.com/do-you-want-to-hear-from-me/">Get my pistol content</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are more projects in mind but I have not yet decided on acting on them. This list will grow and evolve. <a href="https://ramonsuarez.com/challenge-projects/">The next projects and updates will be published here.</a> Follow the blog via <a href="https://ramonsuarez.com/feed/">RSS</a> or <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/y15ohrxE45xGD4bv1">add your email here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-will-i-be-doing-this">How long will I be doing this?</h3>
<p>I’ll be launching new projects until I have enough of businesses and projects going on to keep me busy, happy, and earning enough income.</p>
