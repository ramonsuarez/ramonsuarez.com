Among the books I’ve been reading, one has really hit home: <a href="https://amzn.to/2S3jx5C">Radical Focus: Achieving Your Most Important Goals with Objectives and Key Results</a>.</p>
<p>The title is self explanatory. To work with your OKR (Objectives and Key Results) they recommend having a mission statement for the company to guide you.</p>
<p>My experience with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170701120151/http://www.betacowork.com/mission-vision-and-values/">Mission, Vision and Values of Betacowork</a> was very positive and helpful. So I thought that maybe I can have a mission statement for myself.</p>
<p>Even if I’m not a company, I do have a mission and at times I lose my heading. Having a mission for the long term helps keep everything aligned in the short term. Writing it down makes it much easier to refer to it and to keep it in mind.</p>
<p>I already wrote one for me as a <a href="https://www.olympicpistol.com">competitive shooter</a> to motivate and drive me. So I thought to give it a try and start with this as my professional mission:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Find new sources of revenue and business ideas in Internet and knowledge products by executing new business projects and learning from practice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As always, helpful advice is appreciated and sought after!</p>
