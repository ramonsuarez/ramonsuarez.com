      Since the last time… Last week I spent time going through my business ideation framework and came up with twenty some new ideas easily. I also came up with new questions accelerate the process. The time frame was too short to be able to really work on improving the framework a lot, but at least I improved the spreadsheet to organize the ideas.
So mixed success in last week’s project and now a new challenge.

      Come out with new project ideas for the challenge. Improve the framework itself and think about how to best deliver it. My first sprint ended with 145 ideas in the list and I’ve added 21 more since then. I keep them all in a spreadsheet that is very helpful to filter them out by my criteria: Make, Learn, Invest, Drop, and also to mark some as done and remove them from the list of ideas yet to be made.

      After all the ins and outs of this course, only 4 people signed up. This is far from the target of 10 that I committed to in mastermind/accountability group. So I cancelled it, reimbursed everybody and closed my account in the e-learning platform (I don’t know if I will release it again nor when). In fact this puts on hold the other coworking courses I had in mind (marketing and sales).

      It took a while, but the coworking community course has finally been launched. I kept my timing and the email announcing it went out last Thursday.
Doing a text only course was a good choice. It is much easier to work and rework the content and I can make the delivery much faster. The students have to put their time into doing the tasks to improve their own coworking space community, not on trying to understand my accent in a video.

      One of the things that I have to improve to get my projects off the ground is project management. Among the books I’ve been reading, one has really hit home: Radical Focus: Achieving Your Most Important Goals with Objectives and Key Results.
The title is self explanatory. To work with your OKR (Objectives and Key Results) they recommend having a mission statement for the company to guide you.
My experience with the Mission, Vision and Values of Betacowork was very positive and helpful.

      I’m not good with video yet, but there are many other delivery methods to share valuable content and help many people. So I’m going to continue working on the Coworking Community Course with a text only course.
The core of the course is ready, I have about 130 slides with a mix of information and exercises. It is a workbook focused on getting coworking space operators to take actions that will help them build a vibrant and healthy communities while they are taking the course and that will give provide a toolbox they can keep on using and referring to.

      I stress over the calendar. I know I have an issue with it and that probably feeds the loop. No matter how many tools I use there’s something in me that just makes me stress about setting up and not missing appointments. The worst I’ve done (in terms of time difference) is showing up to an event a month in advance. I’ve also missed a couple flights, but I managed to fix it quick (thanks media production experience!

      Deadlines need to be precise My first mistake when I launched the video course project was not to set a precise deadline. One month from now is not good enough, I need to have a date and time and keep it visible. I can then also prepare a timeline of the project and evaluate my progress towards it in chunks not just for the completion of the whole course.

      Not a habit yet Although I’ve managed to do so many days of continuous meditation practice it is not yet a habit (and I really wish it was). The 21 days rule is not working for me at all.
Not being able to do it every day at the same time because of the ever changing schedule of parenting makes it really hard to stick and adds a bit of angst, of fear of missing a day.

      Two things have contributed to this:
Creator’s block Self confidence Creator’s Block Making and online course is a creator challenge. Even if I’m using the content of my coworking book as the base, I’m adding a lot of content and I’m drafting it for video delivery.
I have a lot of experience writing, but not writing for video. Long gone are my days at Canal + in Spain where I was asked to do some writing.
