      Meditation has had a profound positive impact in my life. Being more aware is bringing a lot of improvements to my actions and feelings. It has improved my work, my personal relationships and my sport practice. I enjoy the benefits of awareness/mindfulness meditation.
I started meditating in 2015 with a book and it was okayish, but when I started using the HeadSpace app I really felt the difference. After doing the fist 10 sessions I noticed that something had already changed in me.

      Donâ€™t miss any of my adventures as a Jedi entrepreneur
Since the public launch of coworking.space last week (and of my entrepreneurship challenge) Iâ€™ve been ramping up the promotion of the service to try to get more spaces in via Facebook groups and pages, reddit, email and some advertising. My post to the coworking Google group is held for moderation.
Sign-ups So far 18 spaces have signed upâ€¦ but only one has drafted the listing following the guidelines and with help from me: Betacowork Coworking Brussels.

      Iâ€™ve taken this out of the original challenge post because it was confusing. Iâ€™ll keep it here for reference. Most of the learning can be found in the posts curated in the entrepreneurship challenge projects page.
These are some of the things I want to learn to do and to improve (in no particular order):
Automation in general and Email automation in particular; Blog monetization and affiliate revenue; Making online courses; Podcasting; Outsourcing and hiring; Marketing automation; ETF / Index tracker investing; Advanced spreadsheet magic; WordPress knowledge and autonomy; Sponsoring; Practice communities; Habit forming; Daily meditation; Give more structure to my work; â€¦ Do you want to hear from me?

      As part of the challenge to launch at least one project/business a month, Iâ€™m going to share here what goes well and what doesnâ€™t. As my good friend and entrepreneur Xavier Corman has pointed out, I have to have clear KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and I think that those KPIs should be public. So here they are:
10 coworking space pages published following the guidelines. And then 30 by Friday. If I donâ€™t see enough traction I will keep the site running but stop promoting it.

      After the sale of my coworking space I took a few months of vacation to charge up and care for my family. I needed to spend time with myself and to get ready for my next entrepreneurial challenge. Thereâ€™s no doubt in my mind that my next step is as an entrepreneur: I want to create a business, buy one, or join one as a partner, not get a job.

      This blog has been abandoned for some time because I thought that some other blogs I had were more relevant for what I wanted to write. But it has been nagging me all the time.
This is the best outlet for my personal thinking, and for a while it was also a kind of web scrapbook (I miss you Posterous). This blog is more about Ramon and his many interests, about ideas, thoughts and doubts.

      One of my reference blogs, LifeHacker, has launched an initiative to get more people to share how they work, a series that they have been doing for some time with known startup &amp; Internet people. Hopefully there will be some good tips here for others like me that are continuously looking to hack their lives to make them better.
For those that do not know me, Iâ€™ve had an eclectic professional experience working as a journalist, producer, political adviser, marketer, and entrepreneur.
