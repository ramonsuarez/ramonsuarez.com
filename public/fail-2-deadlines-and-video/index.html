<h2 id="deadlines-need-to-be-precise">Deadlines need to be precise</h2>
<p>My first mistake when I launched the video course project was not to set a precise deadline. One month from now is not good enough, I need to have a date and time and keep it visible. I can then also prepare a timeline of the project and evaluate my progress towards it in chunks not just for the completion of the whole course.</p>
<h2 id="chunking-progress">Chunking progress</h2>
<p>Having only one result to measure (the completion of the whole course) makes it harder to be conscious of progress, as it is always lacking. I should have defined smaller chunks of the project that where relevant and conducive to the result and that would have kept me on track.</p>
<p>For example, I did all the courses available in Udemy concerning how to make good courses (very helpful) and took notes that I used to work on my own course. I also read all the available documentation they had and checked all their files (mostly templates). I’ve also prepared 139 great slides full of content and with a lot of helpful exercises and tasks.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="video-lessons-are-hard">Video lessons are hard</h2>
<p>I did not think this would be a problem but it is. Speaking in public is not an issue for me; I’m used to giving interviews on radio and TV, conferences to hundreds of people and live streamed, courses… You name it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The problem may come from the courses about making courses themselves: I got into my mind that I have to be super precise and perfect, which I’m not. I tried writing scripts and discovered that I’ve forgotten how to read aloud. The few times I tried was awful. I felt paralyzed, hesitant, with no confidence at all. It sucked.</p>
<h2 id="too-big-an-mvp">Too big an MVP</h2>
<p>I started with the <a href="https://www.coworkinghandbook.com/coworking-community-course-draft/">coworking community course</a> because it is smaller than the sales course I want to do. I thought that the MVP was to do a first online video course, but this has proven to be way too big.</p>
<p>I have to start with something smaller that does not demand so many hours of work on each video.</p>
<h2 id="online--video">Online != Video</h2>
<p>Online courses are not necessarily video courses. I have a lot of good written content and can easily produce more. I’m good at writing. Why impose video on myself? This has multiplied the load of work.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>I’m still going to do the course, but right now I’m exploring how to make it a text based course. I’m researching tools to try to do it as easy as possible on myself to launch and get feedback while providing a hell of a lot of value to the students.</p>
<p>The course is taking shape more like a workbook, with tasks that help improve the community of coworking spaces while the course is ongoing, not only at the end.</p>
<p>I want to improve my project management and I will test using <a href="https://amzn.to/2ssdiKh">OKR (objectives and key results)</a> even if it is just for myself. This book has made me think a lot about it:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="next-deadline--211">Next deadline : 21/1</h2>
<p>This week I will take time to think about my next projects and deadlines and to get a better idea of the effort involved and tools needed. In the morning of Monday 21 I will publish a post with the next project, its deadline and a timeline.</p>
