<p>You probably thought of other tools that are stablished in the market- like Klout, PeerIndex and Kredly- that already do something similar. These competitors are focused on their ranking number and are not so good in defining the right areas of interest and influence.</p>
<p>When I first saw my profile in PeerReach and those of a couple friends I was impacted by the quality and relevance of their categorization.</p>
<p>The service is free for regular users, and business (marketing agencies, communication professionals, etc.) can pay for an API to integrate PeerReach with their own tools.</p>
<p>Nico Schoonderwoerd is the cofounder of an international team directed from Amsterdam. They have recently raised â‚¬250 000.</p>
