As you can see from my posts, I use this blog as a notebook for content I find on the Internet (my memory in the cloud) thanks to Posterous’ wonderful bookmarklet. A few days ago, I went back to one of these “memories” and found that the links were not working (and that although it had over 100 readers, nobody had said a thing about it, but that’s another story).</p>
<p>Here is the message I sent them to report the bug via their <em>Send Feedback</em> link:</p>
<p>There is a persistent <strong>bug that affects links within the text that is shared with the bookmarklet</strong>. When I select a text and click on the bookmarklet everything looks ok, but the links within the text are altered and instead of making refference to the original page they make refference to my own page.</p>
<p>For example: Selecting the text in the page: <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/article/search-ranking-factors">http://www.seomoz.org/article/search-ranking-factors</a> I created this post with the bookmarklet: <a href="http://ramonsuarez.com/search-engine-ranking-factors-2009">http://ramonsuarez.com/search-engine-ranking-factors-2009</a> The links where changed like in this example: <a href="http://ramonsuarez.com/#negative-ranking-factors">http://ramonsuarez.com/#negative-ranking-factors</a> When they should have been like this: <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/article/search-ranking-factors#negative-ranking-factors">http://www.seomoz.org/article/search-ranking-factors#negative-ranking-factors</a> So every time I post content from other sites I have to manually edit the post.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks a lot for your effort in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Posterous<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You have made it so easy to share my thoughts on the stuff I run into when surfing the net that I have found again the joy of blogging.</p>
<p>A couple days later I got an email from Garry Tan with the best message I could get:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the bug report. Spent a few hours and this should be fixed now</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And indeed <strong>it is fixed. Thank you Garry!</strong></p>
