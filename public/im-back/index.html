<p>This is the best outlet for my personal thinking, and for a while it was also a kind of web scrapbook (I miss you Posterous). This blog is more about Ramon and his many interests, about ideas, thoughts and doubts. About new ventures and adventures.</p>
<p>I also made the learning mistake of moving away from WordPress to a static page generator. Iâ€™ve learned from my mistake and Iâ€™m back to the hosted version of WordPress to only worry about writing. It is a much more pleasurable experience. When you see this post it will mean that the transition has been made!</p>
<p>Now Iâ€™m back ðŸ™‚</p>
