<p>After 227 days (almost seven and a half months) of daily meditation I missed one day, which broke the challenge I had set up for myself of <a href="https://ramonsuarez.com/meditate-every-day-for-a-year/">meditating everyday for a year</a>. The people at Headspace kindly reset the counter so that the streak would not be broken when I asked them how many days I had meditated in a row, but this did not change the fact that I had missed a day.</p>
<p>This reset was bugging me, because it was a lie.</p>
<p>And then last Sunday I missed another one which made it much easier to confront questions like does it matter and is it a flop or a win.</p>
<p>The truth is that it does not matter. Using the <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a> app, plus calendar reminders in conjunction with the challenge has been a success in making meditation a daily practice, something that is integrated into my routine.</p>
<p>I have issues with the days that break the routine (usually when there are holidays or days of the weekend with no regular alone time) but missing a day here and there does not really matter when I take into account that I have meditated a lot since December 6 2018 and <a href="https://ramonsuarez.com/meditated-for-100-days/">gotten a lot out of it</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Iâ€™ve succeeded in making mediation work for me like I set myself to do, and thatâ€™s what really matters, not an external sign of recognition in the form of a badge. The fact is that meditation has helped me see the futility of the one year goal ðŸ™‚</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>*: Angel from Headspace responded to my article along the same line ðŸ™‚*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your reply and Iâ€™m happy to see that you are going to continue your practice without focusing on the run streak so much. Thatâ€™s really the goal here, the run streak is used more for the beginning of your journey as a helpful motivation tool to go into the app each day. The hope is that you wonâ€™t feel the need to have this run streak in order to keep your practice going, that youâ€™ll be able to apply the techniques to your daily life without even realizing it.</p>
<p>If you click the link <a href="https://www.headspace.com/blog/2019/02/25/building-a-meditation-practice/">here</a> this is what Andy has to say about the run streak feature.</p>
