<h2 id="choosing-the-right-tool-and-cleaning-up-contacts">Choosing the Right Tool and Cleaning Up Contacts</h2>
<p>I dropped Mautic for being too complicated and awful to clean up contacts (the main problem I have with all the CRM Iâ€™ve tried so far). At the end I went for a much easier set up with the help of a <a href="https://digitalinspiration.com/#addons">Google add-on</a> by <a href="https://digitalinspiration.com/google-developer">Amit Argawal</a>. I had already used his <a href="https://digitalinspiration.com/product/email-address-extractor">Gmail Extractor</a> to build the list with all the email addresses in my inbox.</p>
<p>I ended up with over 90.000 emails in the spreadsheet. Then I de-duplicated them and sent them to a list verification service for some cleanup (sorry but I cannot find the exact one I used, try <a href="https://www.capterra.com/email-verification-tools-software/">this list</a> to find one). I ended up with over 22.000 emails, but I still had to do a lot of cleanup manually.</p>
<p>First I tried with Mautic, but after many hours of hard work I decided to give up. I could not even do a reset of the contacts and delete them all at once to upload a cleaned list from Google Contacts or a cleaned spreadsheet, so I decided to delete the account and look for something simpler and to clean up the contacts in a spreadsheet using filters. Luckily Iâ€™ve made a list of words to use that Iâ€™ve been improving with each cleanup.</p>
<p>At the end I used <a href="https://digitalinspiration.com/product/gmail-mail-merge">Mail Merge</a> by Amit, which is very easy to use (although he fails to reply to support questions).</p>

<h2 id="email-copy">Email Copy</h2>
<p>Initially I had thought of an overly complicated email that had too many choices:</p>
<p><img src="https://ramonsuarez.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/email-segmentation-note-keep.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I kept the original idea but made it (hopefully) simpler. This is the current email template:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi {{First Name}}</p>
<p><em>Sorry if this message pops up out of the blue (donâ€™t worry, there wonâ€™t be a second email).</em></p>
<p>As part of my entrepreneurship challenge Iâ€™m refreshing my network and just went through my inbox to get the email addresses of everybody Iâ€™ve been in touch with in the last few years.</p>
<p>You may know me as the founder of Betacowork, author of The Coworking Handbook, and organizer of startups.be, Betagroup, Startup weekend Brussels and other initiatives. Iâ€™ve organized a lot of events about entrepreneurship, coworking and many other subjects in Brussels that you have probably attended.</p>
<p>To hear from me about entrepreneurship, coworking, Olympic pistol or other subject of your liking please <a href="https://ramonsuarez.com/do-you-want-to-hear-from-me/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post">click here to choose what you are interested in</a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Iâ€™m also looking forward to hear from you. Just reply to this email with your update ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>To me it looks too wordy still, but I thought that it was good enough to send. It includes information to help people understand why Iâ€™m contacting them, remember who I am, and understand how I got their email.</p>
<h2 id="sending-emails-out">Sending Emails Out</h2>
<p>This was a strange week to start sending emails out with the long weekends and vacations, but I think that it is better to be out than to be perfect.</p>
<p>The first two batches where of 50 emails each. 10% have bounced. No complains, no signups.</p>
<p>Today I sent 100 more and got 17% bounces. I saw the email of one of my friends passing by, so I contacted him to see how he got the email. It all looks good:</p>
<p><img src="https://ramonsuarez.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/in-the-inbox.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>He did sign up, but I would not use this as a signal.</p>
<p>I can send up to 1500 emails a day, but Iâ€™m holding the horses because of fear of getting flagged as a spammer. I have not been able to see how to limit the daily send, so Iâ€™ve contacted Amit (he never got back to me). Hopefully heâ€™ll help me figure it out. Right now I have to launch the script manually every day and I want to just launch it and forget about it.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>Next thing to do is to set up the queries in the <a href="https://ramonsuarez.com/do-you-want-to-hear-from-me/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post">suscription spreadsheet</a> to be able to use <a href="https://automate.io">automate.io</a> or <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> to add everyone to the right mail-list automatically. This is part of my <a href="https://ramonsuarez.com/challenge-projects/">challenge</a> and of the <a href="https://ramonsuarez.com/things-to-learn-and-improve-through-practice/">things I want to learn and improve through practice</a>.</p>
